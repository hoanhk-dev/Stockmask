## Message from the President

<!-- image -->

Kajima's corporate philosophy is: "As a group of individuals working together as one, we pursue creative progress and development founded on both rational, scientific principles and a humanitarian outlook, through which we strive to continually advance our business operations and contribute to society." Since our founding in 1840, Kajima has been a "technology-based company," earning the trust of society and clients by emphasizing the development of technology and talent, while continuously delivering advanced construction technologies that meet the evolving needs of the times. Through our ongoing commitment to earning greater trust from society and our customers, we have cultivated advanced expertise in construction technology, valuecreating real estate development, and globally integrated operations—enabling us to expand our business domains and geographic footprint. Going forward, we will continue to deliver solutions and new value that meet the demands of society and the times, with a focus on sustainable growth.

## Carrying forward the Kajima DNA

I recently revisited the original text of the 20 Rules for Succeeding in Business, written by the late Chairman Morinosuke Kajima. Serving as President from 1938 to 1957, he is revered as the "re-founder" of Kajima for his pivotal role in revitalizing the Company. First published in 1936 in our internal newsletter Kajima Gumi Monthly Report, the text clearly conveys the historical context and intent behind his thinking at the time.

I found its message deeply resonant, offering timeless insight into the values that continue to guide our corporate philosophy today. Although written over 80 years ago, its contents were ahead of their time and still feel universal rather than outdated. The 20 Rules for Succeeding in Business include articles such as "Abandon the idea time-honored methods are the best" and "Pay high salaries." Underpinning it all is the philosophy of "devotion to progress and improvement" and the management principle that "Kajima's path lies in 'dynamic stability'—finding stability in the midst of constant expansion and development." These guiding principles continue to serve us well even in today's complex world.

Last December, we held a commemorative event marking 50 years since the passing of Chairman Morinosuke Kajima, honoring his enduring legacy. The occasion provided a meaningful opportunity to reflect on his contributions and renew our dedication to advancing the Company's mission. The history of Kajima, including Chairman Morinosuke's philosophy and achievements, is widely passed down to officers and employees through videos, publications, and internal training. By understanding the history and management philosophy behind our founding, we can cultivate a mindset that is focused on growing Kajima and paving the way for a new chapter in our story. I consider it one of my duties to pass on the enduring Kajima DNA—which has been part of our identity since our foundation—to the employees who will lead us into the next generation.

Page 15 Morinosuke Kajima, the Re-founder of Kajima

## The Kajima Group’s Vision

As a reflection of this Kajima DNA, we have articulated our Group's vision for the company in the form of our Goals. Formulated in conjunction with the Medium-Term Business Plan (FY2024–2026), these Goals were developed based on input from officers and employees and discussed by the Board of Directors. They embody our commitment to making a more positive impact on our customers and the broader society by merging "people" and "technology"—the driving forces behind our value creation. The Kajima DNA can be described as the way of life practiced by our many predecessors, and we intend to continue and build upon it.

To achieve our Goals, we will enhance our domestic construction business, where our Group's greatest strengths lie. We will also expand our real estate development and overseas businesses, which have become new areas of strength, and broaden our value chain, thereby contributing to the development of our business and society. As a global corporate group dedicated to construction and covering diverse functions across the value chain, we aim to be a company recognized worldwide by developing socially beneficial technologies and providing outstanding services.

Our company's foundation is built on "people," "technology," and "trust"—together defining what we call Kajima Quality, or the Kajima Brand. These values have been cultivated by consistently earning the trust and exceeding the expectations of society, our customers, and our partners, through close collaboration and long-term commitment. At all times, we stay true to our fundamentals, act with integrity, and build trust through the excellence and reliability of our technology. We believe that maintaining this stance is fundamental to upholding Kajima Quality and the Kajima Brand. Page 10 Kajima Group Goals

## Awareness of the business environment

The economic outlook has become increasingly uncertain in recent years, shaped by evolving trade and monetary policies across nations as well as rising geopolitical risks. Furthermore, societal expectations and customer needs are expected to continue evolving, with growing emphasis on human capital and stronger calls for a circular economy on the environmental front. We recognize that our role is to accurately grasp these evolving changes and the challenges they present, and to deliver solutions and new value grounded in our robust technological expertise.

In the construction market, stable demand is projected to continue for the time being, both in domestic and international

## Message from the President

sectors. In Japan, we expect medium- to long-term growth in investment related to energy supply issues, infrastructure renewal, and digital transformation. However, rising construction costs must be carefully considered, and building a delivery framework capable of meeting strong demand amid labor shortages remains a key challenge. While thoroughly managing costs, we must improve compensation and working conditions for skilled workers, enhance productivity, and reinforce our construction capabilities, including across the supply chain.

I believe our customers understand the recent sharp rise in construction costs, but they are also facing unprecedented challenges, such as extended construction periods, delayed start dates, and difficulties securing a construction team. Given the current environment, it is vital to foster and maintain relationships where, even if we cannot fully meet a customer's request, we can explore solutions together and always remain available for consultation.

## Review of FY2024

Despite significant changes in the external environment, our Group has continued to increase both revenue and profit, while steadily strengthening the management foundation for sustainable growth, as evidenced by gains in owners' equity and market capitalization.

FY2024, the first year of our new Medium-Term Business Plan, has gotten off to a solid start. We are making steady progress in securing quality-focused construction orders, ensuring reliable project execution, and establishing a sound investment-recovery cycle in our real estate development business. This is due to our improved ability to handle individual projects and the establishment of management methods for each business unit, which have led to stable profit-generating capabilities and robust risk management.

Based on this assessment and our goal of realizing future growth scenarios for each business, we have committed to reaching our FY2030 management target of consolidated net income of ¥150 billion or more ahead of schedule. Page 35 Page 41 Page 43 Medium-Term Business Plan

## Enhancing the profitability of our value chain centered on construction to achieve our goals

## (1) Domestic construction business

For the domestic construction business, where strong demand is expected to continue, we will aim for profit growth centered on improving the gross profit margin. This will be accomplished through thorough risk control and by gaining a competitive advantage in priority areas, including semiconductor production facilities and infrastructure-related projects.

In particular, when accepting construction orders, we remain mindful of strategically allocating our valuable management resources amid strong market demand. We are committed to securing profits through accurate cost estimation grounded in procurement data and market trends, while ensuring robust construction frameworks—including supply chain coordination and appropriate project timelines. We will also transform the new insights and expertise gained from our experience in constructing the latest semiconductor facilities and data centers into even greater strengths.

## (2) Domestic real estate development business and overseas business

Over the next few years, our domestic real estate development business will focus on building a portfolio of prime assets, with investment taking the lead. At the same time, asset sales from previous investments are gradually increasing, steadily boosting our earning capacity. To continue improving profitability, the key lies in meticulously completing the large-scale urban projects currently in progress and raising their profitability to the next level.

Our Group's overseas business aims to achieve higher profitability by responding effectively to regional economic conditions—particularly through our core U.S. logistics warehouse operations and our Asia business, which has entered a phase of renewed growth following the pandemic— while leveraging our integrated platforms in construction and development. Our overseas business has grown to account for one-third of our consolidated revenues, thanks to many years of consistent, locally rooted efforts and the trust built along the way. However, solidifying our current business foundation is also important for further growth.

## (3) Expansion of value chain

Centered on our strengths in the construction and real estate development businesses, we intend to deepen our involvement in peripheral businesses and further expand our Group's business domains.

With the exception of long-term civil engineering projects such as dams, most construction periods take less than three years. However, every project has phases before and after the construction period that offer revenue opportunities for our Group. In particular, after the handover project, buildings and infrastructure are typically operated or used for extended periods. Kajima is a company building for the next 100 years. With construction at the core of our business, we provide end-to-end services—from upstream development, design, and engineering to downstream operation, maintenance, and renewal—enabling us to deliver long-term value to our customers and maintain enduring relationships. We are currently conducting demonstrations at our own facilities— including our R&amp;D hub, The GEAR, in Singapore—and are now able to collect a wide range of data during the operational phase of building projects. By merging data from the design and construction phases with data acquired during operation, we can utilize this data to optimize the physical building itself for more efficient and comfortable operation. This is a domain where our Group can most effectively leverage its competitive

<!-- image -->

advantages. Our policy is to expand revenue opportunities by providing ongoing support throughout the lifecycle of the buildings and infrastructure we deliver—updating their functions and maintaining or enhancing their value.

Given the nature of our business, our Group's growth strategy is not a flashy one that generates enormous profits in a short period by developing and selling epoch-making technologies or new products. One of our core principles is the pursuit of long-term value by relentlessly refining our strengths and aligning with the evolving needs of society and our customers—both current and potential. To realize this, we believe it is essential to make substantial upfront investments— not only in talent and expertise, but also across a broad spectrum of strategic capabilities—even before securing a construction contract. Once a project is in our hands, our focus is on maximizing its value throughout its lifecycle. For example, our company has established a system called "Follow-up Meetings." These are meetings where the leaders of the head office and branch administration departments regularly check in with the project manager regarding each project's SEQDC (Safety, Environment, Quality, Delivery, and Cost). This system functions effectively to nip potential operational problems in the bud. Beyond construction, the administration departments support development projects and related businesses with an appropriate level of involvement, offering insights into external developments and potential risks while collaborating with on-site teams to enhance value creation. The thorough implementation of each of these risk management measures will form the foundation for future growth.

Page 49 Business strategy

## Maintaining the strength of our core business foundation

## Digital and knowledge

Fortunately, our company has continued to perform well, but it is precisely at times like these that it is essential to take additional measures to maintain a strong foundation for our core businesses. Since I became president four years ago, my main focus has been on developing our knowledge base.

The construction process involves a great deal of experiential knowledge. By harnessing digital technology to visualize, organize, and share this knowledge, we are improving the efficiency and quality of our work and increasing the productivity of the entire organization.

Developing our knowledge base also promotes constructive dialogue among employees and contributes to greater psychological safety. An environment where supervisors and subordinates can have rational discussions based on specific data and examples helps enhance work quality and leads to higher productivity. It also contributes to creating an attractive workplace where diverse human resources can thrive in a variety of work styles.

Furthermore, I believe that providing employees with examples of valuable insights, ingenuity, and past failures helps hone their intuition for their work, inspiring new ideas. We will elevate the Kajima Group's organizational intelligence by creating a system in which many employees engage with valuable knowledge and contribute to improving its quality, thereby creating a self-sustaining cycle of improvement. Page 88 Quality

## Our people and technology

While our business is centered on construction, unlike typical manufacturers, we do not operate production facilities or plants. Our true sources of value creation lie in our people and technology. I believe that we can nurture the Kajima Group's ingenuity by strengthening the connection between our human resources and technologies across our sites, departments, and Group companies.

## (1) Our People

I believe that by cultivating a corporate culture that encourages employees to take on diverse challenges while ensuring their initiatives are recognized, appreciated, and supported, each person can work proactively and lead a fulfilling life. The foundation of our human capital management is to create an environment where everyone—including the skilled construction workers of our partner companies who support our sites—can work with a sense of purpose and fulfillment, fully leveraging their skills and capabilities.

With the work style reform laws having come into full effect in the construction industry as of April 2024, the entire sector is undergoing a major transition. We view this as a strategic opportunity for transformation and have been actively promoting operational efficiency and the adoption of smarter ways of working.

Now that the evolution of AI and digitalization is fundamentally transforming the nature of manufacturing, we must return to our roots as a technology-based company and strive to efficiently pass on the wisdom and experience— grounded in our technological expertise—to the next generation of engineers and professionals. In line with these

## Message from the President

changes, we are also reviewing our employees' work styles and development systems.

In the growing field of inbound projects commissioned by foreign-affiliated companies, our global footprint and proven expertise in overseas project management serve as key strengths. Building on these capabilities, we are enhancing our overseas assignment programs for technical employees to prepare for the future.

We are also focusing on creating an environment where diverse human resources can thrive. Specifically, to support women's careers, we have set a new target to increase the proportion of female managers. We are designing systems that allow employees to continue working with peace of mind, even as they go through life events. We are also promoting initiatives that provide early work experience, such as assigning employees with a certain level of expertise to handle core tasks and critical challenges essential for their future careers in a planned and timely way.

For the skilled construction workers at our partner companies, who are vital to our business, we are working with industry organizations such as the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors to improve their benefits and promote the introduction of the Construction Career Up System. We are also continuing our own unique initiatives, such as the Kajima Partner College and the establishment of a construction system that, in principle, limits subcontracting to the secondary level.

## (2) Technology

Our basic R&amp;D policy is to strengthen our construction business and tackle themes that help solve social issues, while actively promoting collaboration and cooperation with external parties.

We have been a leader in construction technology for many years, including the establishment of the industry's first technical research institute in 1949. For example, our seismic damping and isolation technology originated in the construction of Japan's first skyscraper, the Kasumigaseki Building, in 1968. Through continuous improvement and evolution—including the construction of the world's first building with an active control system—our technology remains at the global forefront today. Our people and technology have been highly evaluated externally. In recognition of our contributions to the advancement of science and technology and industrial development in Japan, we received the prestigious National Commendation for Invention. We will continue to strive for further excellence.

In recent years, we have focused on disseminating and deploying technologies in the infrastructure renewal field, such as the Smart Deck Renewal (SDR) System and our automated construction technology (A 4 CSEL).

We also have extensive knowledge and a proven track record in the increasingly important fields of energy and the environment, particularly in nuclear and renewable energy. In the nuclear power field, we built Japan's first nuclear reactor in 1957 based on our seismic technology. Since then, we have continuously been involved in constructing nuclear facilities across the country and currently have a Nuclear Power Department with over 150 specialists and construction teams with a proven track record nationwide. In the offshore wind power field, we were responsible for the construction of the Akita Port and Noshiro Port Offshore Wind Farms (completed in 2023), Japan's first commercial offshore wind power project. In other areas, we are focusing on implementation and commercialization. In wood-frame construction, for instance, our Tohoku Branch building is being reconstructed as a flagship wooden structure incorporating various elemental technologies. In the environmental field, we constructed a dome with our eco-friendly concrete, CUCO-SUICOM, at the Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan.

In addition to company-wide R&amp;D, I place great value on the innovations driven by the insights, intellectual curiosity, and spirit of inquiry of each individual employee on the front lines. These continuous challenges are the source of the Kajima Group's competitiveness and enhance our sustainability as a technology-based company.

Therefore, we create opportunities for employees working hard on the front lines to leverage their intuition, explore new ideas, and experiment within the scope of the site manager's supervision, even with the prospect of failure. We have established systems and allocated budgets to support employees' initiatives while also providing opportunities for presentations and recognition, thereby helping successful outcomes spread throughout the organization. Through ongoing dialogue with employees, I have seen encouraging signs that this mindset is gradually taking root.

Page 69 Human Resources Strategy

Page 81 Environment

## Supply chain

According to data from the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, the number of skilled construction workers in Japan peaked at 4.64 million in FY1997 and has been gradually decreasing, reaching 3.03 million in FY2024. Based on the average rate of decline over the last 10 years (-1.26% per year), the number is projected to fall to 2.80 million by FY2030 and 2.64 million by FY2035.

The construction industry is a highly social and public-facing industry that aims to provide high-quality social capital. It is also one of the oldest industries in history. I also believe it is a stable and enduring industry, supported by countless past experiences and wisdom. Whereas general manufacturing industries generate revenue through researching, developing, producing, and selling products, the construction industry estimates costs based on design drawings, sets a price for a final product that does not yet exist, and delivers it while receiving payment. A distinctive feature is that, even for the same building, there are multiple construction methods, and the production process itself is carefully evaluated. This tests the wisdom and abilities of the engineers and offers the joy of creating something unique. In this profession, one can grow over a long period,

gradually accumulating experience and acquiring necessary skills and knowledge, all while experiencing the true pleasure of manufacturing—the sense of scale of the structures themselves and, at times, the challenge of confronting nature.

However, if we do not enhance the appeal of the construction industry in line with the changing times and encourage young people to join, the sustainability of the industry will be lost. We are currently working together with our partner companies to improve the benefits of skilled construction workers and to recruit and train human resources. Our outside directors also advised us that, in conjunction with the new long-term vision recently announced by the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, I have a duty to promote these internal aspects of our construction industry more broadly to society.

Page 79 Secure the future workforce

## In closing

As a company that provides safety and security to society, we are expected to realize fair and appropriate management with the values and ethics required of being a member of society. While performance figures are, of course, important, what is truly important for a company is its employees' sense of accomplishment and satisfaction with the quality of their work and their constant desire for these things. This healthy desire is the source of the Kajima Group's strength, supporting the Company from its foundations and preventing quality defects and compliance issues. My goal is to build a corporate group with this same high level of engagement.

To achieve sustainable growth, our policy is to consider all stakeholders and provide appropriate returns. In addition to rewarding our employees with wages, we are steadily advancing human capital investment in areas such as improving the work environment, maintaining dormitories and company housing, and providing education and training. I believe that enhancing the added value of our services through technology development and human resource training leads to returns for society, our customers, and our shareholders.

Furthermore, we need to take a more proactive role in providing returns that strengthen the construction industry's foundation as a whole. This includes enhancing benefits for skilled workers and supporting our partner companies, which face the urgent challenge of securing a future workforce. For our stockholders, we have outlined our policy on stockholder returns. We aim to expand returns through dividend increases linked to profit growth and share buybacks, balanced with investments that strengthen our management foundation, including our earning power.

Even as times change, we will continuously update the way our company operates to remain the company of choice for customers, society, partner companies, shareholders, investors, and potential employees, both in Japan and overseas. I sincerely ask for your continued and unwavering support of the Kajima Group.

## History of Kajima

The history of Kajima extends back more than 180 years since its founding. We have pursued trailblazing initiatives that anticipated the needs of the times and have met the needs of society, thereby contributing to the development of Japan's industry and economy. This enterprising spirit is still passed down as our corporate culture as we continue to take on new challenges.

## 1840-

## Leadership in Western-style buildings

Kajima was founded in 1840 by Iwakichi Kajima, a skilled carpenter who frequented daimyo residences in Edo. He expanded to Yokohama, where construction flourished as an open port under the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States. After building Ei-Ichiban Kan, Yokohama's first foreign trading house, Kajima became widely recognized as a pioneer for Western-style buildings.

<!-- image -->

## Leadership in railways and dams

Iwazo Kajima, second-generation leader, established Kajima Gumi in 1880 and started a railway subcontracting business, taking the opportunity of the Tsuruga Line construction. He built a substantial reputation in the railway field and expanded into dam construction to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity, including Japan's first concrete high dam, the Ohmine Dam, which contributed to Japan's development.

1938-1957 (Tenure as President)

## Morinosuke Kajima, the Re-founder of Kajima

Morinosuke Kajima, the company's fourth-generation leader, initiated reforms such as modernizing and rationalizing its management. He also founded the industry's first Kajima Technical Research Institute, laying the groundwork for Kajima's evolution into a technology-based company. His management philosophy, known as the 20 Rules for Succeeding in Business , is still considered one of the universal values upheld by the Kajima Group.

<!-- image -->

## 20 Rules for Succeeding in Business

Outlined below are the main principles.

Article 1 Abandon the idea that time-honored methods are the best.

Article 2 Always try to make an improvement. Don ’ t say “It can ’ t be done”, but make an effort.

Article 3 Train capable leaders.

Article 4 A company which fails to develop human resources will court ruin.

[. . .]

Article 7 Pay high salaries.

[. . .]

Article 10 Use machines as much as possible.

[. . .]

Article 14 Don’t neglect the adoption of new ideas and new methods.

1980-

Promoting overseas business

Kajima participated in the redevelopment of Little Tokyo in the city of Los Angeles in 1964 and entered the U.S. market. We

established Kajima U.S.A. Inc. in the U.S., Kajima Europe Ltd. in the U.K., and Kajima Overseas Asia Pte. Ltd.* in Singapore in the

1980s. With the addition of Kajima Corporation (China) Co., Ltd.,

Chung-Lu Construction Co., Ltd., and Kajima Australia Pty Ltd, we are developing businesses that are rooted in local

communities at our six regional bases.

2020-

Opening up the future together with society and customers

As societal and customer needs become more diverse, including environmental challenges and digitalization, we are

actively constructing renewable energy and production facilities and developing eco-friendly materials. We are

developing our technology and expertise in the construction and real estate development businesses to continue

strengthening our core operations. At the same time, we are creating new value by expanding our value chain, investing in

R&amp;D, and promoting innovation, all with the goal of achieving a sustainable society.

1960-

Leadership in skyscrapers

With the Kajima Technical Research Institute at our core, we advanced technological development and successfully completed Japan’s first skyscraper,

the Kasumigaseki Building, in 1968. Since then, we have built skyscrapers throughout the country, earning a reputation as a leader in the field. In the

1980s, we created seismic damping devices and completed the world’s first structure with an active control system. We continue to lead the world as a

top provider of seismic damping and isolation technologies.

Little Tokyo (development completed in 2007, Los Angeles, U.S.)

2000-

Branching out into real estate development

The impetus for Kajima’s full-scale entry into the development of large-scale mixed-use facilities was the development of Shiki New Town, a large housing

project that began in 1971. In the 2000s, we began participating in urban renewal projects, including the Akihabara Crossfield and the Toranomon

Towers Office &amp; Residence. Since then, we have leveraged our technological skills and comprehensive capabilities as a general contractor-developer with

design-build capabilities to develop attractive urban communities.

## Sources of Value Creation

Since our founding, we have nurtured our human resources and technology—the sources of our value creation—by embracing a corporate culture that takes pride in being a technology-based company and embodies an enterprising spirit. By leveraging capital accumulated throughout our history of value creation, we will earn greater trust from our customers and society. We will achieve this by enhancing safety and health, the environment, and quality, which are the cornerstones of our corporate activities, and by creating new value.

<!-- image -->

## The Corporate Culture Rooted in Kajima

## Pride in being a technology-based company

Building on our role in contributing to the development of industry and the economy through construction technology, we have adopted the motto "Kajima, the Technology Company." We have a deep-rooted culture of delivering advanced technologies that earn the trust of society.

## Enterprising spirit

The 20 Rules for Succeeding in Business from our refounder, Morinosuke Kajima, have become a core principle for every employee. This has cultivated a mindset that recognizes and encourages new ideas and the value of taking on challenges, with key phrases like "Abandon the idea that time-honored methods are the best" and "Don ' t neglect the adoption of new ideas and new methods."

## Our Five Strengths, Driven by Human Resources and Technology

## Business creativity

Our ability to create business by leveraging our construction technologies, our expertise in real estate development, and our network of customers and partners.

## Design capabilities

Our ability to provide advanced design and engineering technologies in fields including design, structure, and equipment.

## Construction capabilities

Our ability to build high-quality structures using our professional expertise, cutting-edge technologies, and supply chain.

## Proposal capabilities

Our ability to make optimal proposals by utilizing our understanding of true needs, internal and external technology and knowledge, and our networks.

## Management capabilities

Our ability to coordinate many stakeholders including society, customers, and partner companies, and ensure success in our businesses.

## Foundation of Trust: Our Basic Policies

## Safety and Health Policy

Based on the philosophy that safety and health are barometers of a company's competence and conscience, we will collaborate with partner companies on proactive initiatives to prevent disasters and accidents in construction work. We also aim to improve the workplace safety and health environment while promoting well-being.

## Environmental Policy

Our goal is to promote a long-term environmental vision throughout the entire company and work toward a sustainable society that balances environmental conservation and economic activities.

## Quality Policy

We offer products and services that meet our customers' needs, from sales to after-sales support, so that they can order from us with confidence and peace of mind.

Human capital

In every phase of the construction value chain, our diverse human resources with advanced expertise meet the expectations of our

stakeholders, particularly our customers and society. Diverse human resources operate worldwide, with locally-rooted locations in the

U.S., Europe, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.

Intellectual capital

As a technology-based company, Kajima develops and verifies new technologies and advanced construction methods. Our numerous

experienced engineers apply the Kajima Group’s technical expertise on-site. Rather than solely depending on our own

resources, we also adopt superior technologies from outside Kajima by promoting the search for cutting-edge technologies,

collaboration through open innovation, and technology development in Japan and overseas.

Financial capital

By operating construction and real estate development as two core businesses with different earnings structures, we bring stability to

our Group management and secure a sound financial foundation.

invest in sustainable growth and deliver returns to stakeholders.

Manufactured capital / Social and relationship capital

We actively invest in building trusted relationships with stakeholders, including customers, local communities, and partner

companies, in our business domains and regions. These strong relationships ultimately create new business opportunities, driving

the continued growth of the Kajima Group.

Natural capital

We are committed to conducting our business activities in a manner that protects and restores natural capital, a finite resource.

To achieve this, we quantitatively assess our environmental footprint and take proactive measures to mitigate its impact.

Recognizing the interconnectedness and trade-offs among the three area of carbon neutrality, resource circularity, and nature

positivity, we strive for a balanced approach.

## Feature 1

## Kajima’s engineers: forged in the field

As its business domains and scale expand, Kajima is focusing on human resource development. Centered on on-site work, we provide training tailored to the motivation and skill acquisition of young and mid-career employees, showing them a path to becoming project managers who can oversee specialized teams. This feature explores how Kajima engineers inherit skills and ideals through their work on two large-scale projects: the tunnel for the new Haneda Airport Access Line connecting central Tokyo to its main airport, and the construction of Rapidus' cutting-edge IIM-1 production facility (Hokkaido), which aims to revive Japan's domestic semiconductor industry.

## Young, mid-career and veteran engineers gather for shield tunnel construction

## Haneda Airport Access Line

Kajima sets its human resource development policies according to job type. For mechanical and electrical engineers, after developing foundational skills up to their 3rd year and applied skills up to their 7th year, they develop management skills by their 13th year. For civil engineers, the first six years after joining the Company are a key development period for learning the fundamentals of construction management and design. This is followed by a growth promotion period up to their 13th year, during which they deepen their expertise and acquire the knowledge needed for the project manager.

## The start of a career

For Sachi Kito, who joined the Company in 2023, her career started when she attended a Kajima information session while studying mechanical engineering at university. "I visited the construction site for the Kuden-Kasama Tunnel on the Yokohama Ring Expressway South Line and saw the magnificent scale of the tunnel boring machine and the precision of the central control room systems. It completely changed my impression of dusty construction sites. I decided to join the Company when I learned that mechanical and electrical engineers handle the operations and that I could be directly involved in the construction work even with a mechanical engineering background."

After six months of training at the Tokyo Civil Engineering Branch, she learned the basics of site management at the Koto Pumping Station construction project office. She then worked in the Mechatronics Solutions Department, visiting sites while helping to create construction management guidelines. In April 2024,

she was assigned to her long-desired post at the Haneda Airport Access Line shield tunnel project. "Right now, I'm in charge of planning the on-site assembly of the shield machine, which has an 11.8-meter-diameter circular cutter, inside the launch base, with excavation set to start in 2026. With my limited experience, I'm finding it difficult to anticipate necessary maintenance, foresee potential problems and organize all the information." While receiving advice from senior colleagues, she also participated in defining the specifications for a device that is key to operating the tunnel boring machine. "I learned so much, including about the process of technological development and machine structures. My first goal is to complete this project with zero accidents. I want to become a trusted engineer by fully understanding the machinery and tenaciously engaging with the work on-site."

## Gaining a holistic perspective from construction and design

In addition to daily on-site training, we offer group training for specialized fields such as design and IT, as well as a job rotation system that provides a wide range of experience. Hatsutaro Kajikawa, Assistant Project Manager of the Haneda Access Line project, gained experience in construction management at shield tunnel sites for sewers and city gas pipelines after joining Kajima. From his 13th year, he spent nine years in the Civil Engineering Design Division, where he was responsible for making technical proposals to clients. "A turning point for me was being involved in the development of the segments (the structures lining the tunnel walls) for the Shinagawa Line of the Metropolitan Expressway's Central Circular Route," he recalls. "I applied my on-site experience to reduce the workload from the design stage and to consider profitability."

Since April 2024, he has served as the Managing Engineer for the Haneda Access Line project, responsible for external negotiations and coordinating schedules with the client and surrounding facilities. "My experience in both construction and design deepened my technical knowledge and cultivated my ability to see the project as a whole, which greatly benefits my current work,” he explains. “I aim not just to provide construction

skills, but to build trusting relationships with all stakeholders and respond with integrity to achieve the required performance.”

Assistant Project Manager Kajikawa learned this approach from Yoshihiko Shibata, the project manager for the Haneda

Access Line. He recalls Shibata’s impressive way of building trusting relationships with stakeholders, while they worked

together on the Shinagawa Line site. Project manager Shibata said, “Although equipment contractors for things like ventilation

and fire suppression are also involved in tunnel construction, it is

Kajima that leads the project. We aim to earn the trust of society and our customers through safe, secure and stable construction.”

He has spent most of his construction career, which began in the 1990s, on shield tunnel sites, experiencing the evolution

of technology and increasingly difficult construction conditions.

“With the shield construction method, you can’t visually check the path ahead. This makes it crucial to visualize the ground

conditions by leveraging all available monitoring technology and your own five senses,” he explains. As shield tunnel

construction stagnated for a time, raising concerns about

For building construction engineers, the career path starts with a five-year development period, followed by

position preparation (years 6–9) and appointment (years

10–13), leading to a project manager role from year 14.

During the introductory period, new employees gain experience on foundational projects such as apartments

and offices, learning various tasks including interior and exterior finishing.

technology succession, he has worked to teach these rules of thumb verbally while also developing manuals and systems.

“A key mission of this project is to develop personnel. I tell our young and mid-career staff that it’s important to be

proactive in making proposals and taking on new challenges. I

want them to overcome their fear of failure and quickly grasp both the difficulties and the joys of construction.”

Project Manager drawn to the work of construction management of building

structures on-site together with the craftspeople, and decided to join the Company.” After joining Kajima in 2022 and

working at the Kanto Branch, she was assigned in August 2023

to the IIM-1 construction project from its very start. She was in charge of the extra-high voltage substation building that

supplies electricity to the main building, and gained experience in all work types from ground improvement to foundations,

structure, finishing, and inspections in about 10 months. With the semiconductor industry facing fierce development

competition that demands an extremely short construction period, she noted, “Since ours was the first building to be

completed, it was difficult to proceed with the work without a role model to follow. I worked closely with the colleagues

including the managers of the other buildings to ensure there were no reworks.”

When initially assigned, she was anxious about working on such a large site, which had about 5,500 workers at its peak,

but she has broadened her perspective by meeting many senior colleagues. “Even with the roles being so specialized, my

experienced senior colleagues knew exactly who was doing what,” Komori stated. “I want to deepen my experience and

knowledge to become someone people feel they can entrust with any task.”

Yuta Sato, an Assistant Manager who was assigned to the project in March 2024, is in his ninth year with the Company,

marking his position appointment preparation period. Inspired by his grandfather, who was a carpenter, he longed to enter

the world of craftsmanship and has experience working on hotel and pharmaceutical factory sites. “I wanted to be

involved in large-scale building projects, and that’s why I chose

Kajima,” he explains. At IIM-1, where his wish has been fulfilled, he has successively overseen steel frame, exterior, and

interior work on the main building, in step with construction progress. “Through this experience, I was able to witness

firsthand how an entire building takes shape. Looking ahead, I

want to become a Deputy Manager and take on the challenge of managing the overall schedule of a project.”

Following the successive completions of the Yokkaichi Plant

Fab 7 for memory giant Kioxia in Mie Prefecture (2022) and the first JASM facility in Kumamoto Prefecture (2023) in which

TSMC holds majority stake, Kajima secured the construct for

IIM-1. The pilot line, which occupies about half of the building, began operation in April 2025 as planned, and construction is

now underway toward the start of mass production in 2027.

Koichi Takano, the General Project Manager for the IIM-1

construction, emphasized, “Rapidus aims to have the people who were active in the era when Japan led the semiconductor

industry pass on their skills to young and mid-career professionals. For Kajima as well, this is a crucial project for

passing the baton to the next generation.”

Since joining the Company in 1987, Takano has worked on projects such as electronic component factories, primarily in

the Chubu region. His career path was set in 2003 when he became project manager for an LCD component factory. “The

manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors, which requires precision processing, needs clean rooms

capable of filtering even micron-level particles—one millionth of a meter. Performance requirements are clearly specified, and

as an engineer, I found it appealing that the results are evaluated numerically,” he recalls.

After accumulating clean room expertise on sites for pharmaceutical and cutting-edge LCD factories, the last

remaining challenge for him as a project manager was

semiconductors. Although activity among Japanese

manufacturers has gradually declined, demand for new

production facilities has surged in recent years amid

tightening supply and demand conditions. Kajima

responded with a unified design-and-build approach,

paving the way with its work on Kioxia’s Yokkaichi plant. General Project Manager Takano,

who had never worked at a semiconductor factory site before, said, “I realized that the volume of work is overwhelmingly larger

than for LCD factories. The proportion of equipment-related work—such as the water for cleaning substrates and the air

conditioning to maintain cleanliness—is high, so we have to work as a team with the equipment contractors.”

At IIM-1, he is leveraging that experience to proactively pass on construction techniques specific to semiconductor factories,

such as those for clean rooms and seismic resistance. To ensure a common understanding throughout this large-scale site,

Takano entrusts this mission to mid-career project manager candidates during their term of appointment

.

Takaki Hibino, Deputy Manager responsible for equipment work in semiconductor factory construction, notes the challenges: “In

addition to HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, this work requires expertise in special gases, chemical solutions, and water

treatment—knowledge rarely needed on other projects.” After studying environmental engineering in graduate school, he

joined Kajima in 2012 and gained over 10 years of experience on electronic component factory sites. At IIM-1, he is taking on a

new role in equipment construction management (Equipment

CM). Normally, when equipment installation is contracted separately, coordination among contractors is handled by the

client. However, as Rapidus was newly established, it entrusted this responsibility to Kajima. With many contractors and

frequent scheduling clashes, Hibino says, “I’ve developed interpersonal skills to draw on past knowledge, identify common

ground, and proactively guide projects. I want to experience all kinds of roles and aim to become a project manager.”

Masanari Akamatsu, Deputy Manager working alongside

General Project Manager Takano and formerly from the Kioxia

Yokkaichi plant site, joined Kajima in 2014 to build landmark structures. He gained construction management experience at

Tokyo Architectural Construction and Yokohama branches and managed overall project planning at the Chubu Branch. He

currently coordinates the entire project plan, including the main IIM-1 building and other structures such as water

treatment and extra-high voltage substations. Learning from

Takano’s communication-focused approach and his belief that

“a project site is all about the people,” Akamatsu remarked,

“With so many parties involved, opinions can clash, but I

maintain close communication so everyone stays aligned.”

Kajima has demonstrated its prowess in semiconductor factory construction by successfully building the large-scale

IIM-1 pilot line on a fast-track schedule. General Project

Manager Takano expresses his hopes: “This project demands expertise, so I want personnel like Akamatsu, who can form

the project core, to be selected early and play a greater role.”

Akamatsu shared his determination: “I want to become a project manager quickly and lead a project that succeeds

because it was a Kajima project.”

## Passing the baton: From semiconductor factory pioneers to the next generation

## Rapidus IIM-1 Construction Project

For building construction engineers, the career path starts with a five-year development period, followed by position preparation (years 6–9) and appointment (years 10–13), leading to a project manager role from year 14. During the introductory period, new employees gain experience on foundational projects such as apartments and offices, learning various tasks including interior and exterior finishing.

## Broadening perspectives on a large-scale project

Yuriko Komori, who majored in design at university, said that when she attended a Kajima site tour as a student, she "was drawn to the work of construction management of building structures on-site together with the craftspeople, and decided to join the Company." After joining Kajima in 2022 and working at the Kanto Branch, she was assigned in August 2023 to the IIM-1 construction project from its very start. She was in charge of the extra-high voltage substation building that supplies electricity to the main building, and gained experience in all work types from ground improvement to foundations, structure, finishing, and inspections in about 10 months. With the semiconductor industry facing fierce development competition that demands an extremely short construction period, she noted, "Since ours was the first building to be completed, it was difficult to proceed with the work without a role model to follow. I worked closely with the colleagues

including the managers of the other buildings to ensure there were no reworks.”

When initially assigned, she was anxious about working on such a large site, which had about 5,500 workers at its peak,

but she has broadened her perspective by meeting many senior colleagues. “Even with the roles being so specialized, my

experienced senior colleagues knew exactly who was doing what,” Komori stated. “I want to deepen my experience and

knowledge to become someone people feel they can entrust with any task.”

Yuta Sato, an Assistant Manager who was assigned to the project in March 2024, is in his ninth year with the Company,

marking his position appointment preparation period. Inspired by his grandfather, who was a carpenter, he longed to enter

the world of craftsmanship and has experience working on hotel and pharmaceutical factory sites. “I wanted to be

involved in large-scale building projects, and that’s why I chose

Kajima,” he explains. At IIM-1, where his wish has been fulfilled, he has successively overseen steel frame, exterior, and

interior work on the main building, in step with construction progress. “Through this experience, I was able to witness

firsthand how an entire building takes shape. Looking ahead, I

want to become a Deputy Manager and take on the challenge of managing the overall schedule of a project.”

Following the successive completions of the Yokkaichi Plant

Fab 7 for memory giant Kioxia in Mie Prefecture (2022) and the first JASM facility in Kumamoto Prefecture (2023) in which

TSMC holds majority stake, Kajima secured the construct for

IIM-1. The pilot line, which occupies about half of the building, began operation in April 2025 as planned, and construction is

now underway toward the start of mass production in 2027.

Koichi Takano, the General Project Manager for the IIM-1

construction, emphasized, “Rapidus aims to have the people who were active in the era when Japan led the semiconductor

industry pass on their skills to young and mid-career professionals. For Kajima as well, this is a crucial project for

passing the baton to the next generation.”

Since joining the Company in 1987, Takano has worked on projects such as electronic component factories, primarily in

the Chubu region. His career path was set in 2003 when he became project manager for an LCD component factory. “The

manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors, which requires precision processing, needs clean rooms

capable of filtering even micron-level particles—one millionth of a meter. Performance requirements are clearly specified, and

as an engineer, I found it appealing that the results are evaluated numerically,” he recalls.

After accumulating clean room expertise on sites for pharmaceutical and cutting-edge LCD factories, the last

remaining challenge for him as a project manager was

semiconductors. Although activity among Japanese

manufacturers has gradually declined, demand for new

production facilities has surged in recent years amid

tightening supply and demand conditions. Kajima

responded with a unified design-and-build approach,

paving the way with its work on Kioxia’s Yokkaichi plant. General Project Manager Takano,

who had never worked at a semiconductor factory site before, said, “I realized that the volume of work is overwhelmingly larger

than for LCD factories. The proportion of equipment-related work—such as the water for cleaning substrates and the air

conditioning to maintain cleanliness—is high, so we have to work as a team with the equipment contractors.”

At IIM-1, he is leveraging that experience to proactively pass on construction techniques specific to semiconductor factories,

such as those for clean rooms and seismic resistance. To ensure a common understanding throughout this large-scale site,

Takano entrusts this mission to mid-career project manager candidates during their term of appointment

.

Takaki Hibino, Deputy Manager responsible for equipment work in semiconductor factory construction, notes the challenges: “In

addition to HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, this work requires expertise in special gases, chemical solutions, and water

treatment—knowledge rarely needed on other projects.” After studying environmental engineering in graduate school, he

joined Kajima in 2012 and gained over 10 years of experience on electronic component factory sites. At IIM-1, he is taking on a

new role in equipment construction management (Equipment

CM). Normally, when equipment installation is contracted separately, coordination among contractors is handled by the

client. However, as Rapidus was newly established, it entrusted this responsibility to Kajima. With many contractors and

frequent scheduling clashes, Hibino says, “I’ve developed interpersonal skills to draw on past knowledge, identify common

ground, and proactively guide projects. I want to experience all kinds of roles and aim to become a project manager.”

Masanari Akamatsu, Deputy Manager working alongside

General Project Manager Takano and formerly from the Kioxia

Yokkaichi plant site, joined Kajima in 2014 to build landmark structures. He gained construction management experience at

Tokyo Architectural Construction and Yokohama branches and managed overall project planning at the Chubu Branch. He

currently coordinates the entire project plan, including the main IIM-1 building and other structures such as water

treatment and extra-high voltage substations. Learning from

Takano’s communication-focused approach and his belief that

“a project site is all about the people,” Akamatsu remarked,

“With so many parties involved, opinions can clash, but I

maintain close communication so everyone stays aligned.”

Kajima has demonstrated its prowess in semiconductor factory construction by successfully building the large-scale

IIM-1 pilot line on a fast-track schedule. General Project

Manager Takano expresses his hopes: “This project demands expertise, so I want personnel like Akamatsu, who can form

the project core, to be selected early and play a greater role.”

Akamatsu shared his determination: “I want to become a project manager quickly and lead a project that succeeds

because it was a Kajima project.”

Yuriko Komori, who majored in design at university, said that when she attended a Kajima site tour as a student, she “was

drawn to the work of construction management of building structures on-site together with the craftspeople, and decided

Koji Motoyama

Principal Architect, Architectural Design Division

“The semiconductor industry has a lot of specialized terms and unique procedures for handling ultra-short construction periods

that you can’t understand without experiencing them firsthand,”

he notes. There are cases where we only have a few days to prepare a proposal, and it’s crucial to build trust by having

repeated conversations with the client in a short time. That’s why

I ask our young architects to handle presentations from their second or third year. At first, they struggle to answer technical

questions, but I want them to feel the excitement of working alongside clients who are competing on the world stage.”

Daisuke Itonaga

Production Chief, Architectural Design Department

“I was assigned to Mr. Motoyama’s group right after joining the Company, and at first, I was constantly learning from the

client and senior colleagues. However, seeing my senior colleagues bring everyone together to move projects forward

taught me the importance of working as a team instead of struggling alone. At IIM-1, I’m in charge of the exterior

design, and we’re collaborating with

Chitose City to create a design that makes the most of the natural

environment. I want to continue taking on the kind of large-scale

projects that are unique to Kajima.”

## The global expansion of industrial development From the U.S. to Europe, Southeast Asia and Australia

To expand its real estate development business, Kajima is promoting the global rollout of its industrial development. Since the 1980s, one of our U.S. subsidiaries has managed the complete development process from land acquisition and planning to tenant acquisition and operations, building a strong track record and deep expertise. As the importance of logistics warehouses grows with the spread of e-commerce and the deepening of supply chains, we are expanding our highly profitable and stable business model to Europe, Southeast Asia and Australia to achieve further growth.

<!-- image -->

## Regional platforms

The key driving force behind Kajima's industrial property development is Core5 Industrial Partners (Core5), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Established in 2015 by those who had played major roles in industrial development business under Kajima U.S.A. (KUSA) for more than 20 years, Core5 has developed approximately 4.92 million m 2 of new space over the last 10 years.

One of the primary drivers of our growth so far has been our key regional directors, who have deep-rooted local networks. In addition to its Head Office, Core5 has four regional offices in key logistics hubs: California, Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Supported by KUSA's solid balance sheet, Core5 has set a strong development track record in each region, where seasoned experts align with local needs to build a resilient and effective business platform. Thanks to the programmatic nature of its business, Core5 has earned the trust of local partners, including property agents and general contractors, granting access to valuable first-hand information on future development sites.

The resilient nature of the business is also explained by the careful timing of new starts in line with changes in the economic cycle. Having witnessed sharp declines in warehouse demand during events such as the dot-com bubble collapse and the 2008 financial crisis, Core5 takes a disciplined approach to underwriting each new project. It carefully analyzes supply-demand dynamics in individual submarkets and closely tracks the leasing and sales performance of its existing portfolio.

A merchant development business model

Industrial properties in the U.S. are typically single-story buildings, and their construction timelines are generally shorter

than those of office buildings or multifamily residential complexes. Core5 has established a merchant development

business model featuring a construction period of approximately 10 months from land acquisition to building

delivery, with a full investment cycle of about three years to recycle capital for future projects. As a result, Core5 has

established a strong presence in key industrial markets, exemplified by its top-three ranking as a commercial real estate

developer in Atlanta during 2020–2021. For the three years starting from FY2022, Core5 has solidified a highly profitable

structure with cumulative revenues of over ¥270 billion and net income of over ¥45 billion, leading the growth of Kajima’s

overseas real estate development business.

In Europe, we began a joint venture with Panattoni Europe in

2016. Panattoni, known as a repeated client of our construction division in Eastern European countries, has also become our

partner in the development field. We are working on projects in seven countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the

Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy. To date, we have undertaken 34 development projects and sold 20 of them (as of

March 31, 2025), putting the business on a growth trajectory.

In Southeast Asia, a hub for manufacturing, we launched the industrial real estate brand Core5 Vietnam in 2022.

Targeting the high-demand market for rental factories, we are leveraging the track record and creditworthiness of our U.S.

industrial development to develop three properties in the northern port cities such as Haiphong and Quang Ninh. We

also have a cold storage warehouse under development in

Singapore, and in 2024, we started the development of our first project in Melbourne, Australia.

While market entry strategies vary across geographies, we are advancing our merchant development in industrial

properties through strategic partnerships with local professionals. Global expansion will remain a key focus,

helping us boost profit and optimize investment returns.

Entering the domestic market with the KALOC brand

As demand for logistics warehouses grows in Japan, Kajima has entered the market under the “KALOC”* brand to meet

logistics needs in urban and suburban areas. The initial projects, “KALOC TOMIYA” in Tomiya City, Miyagi and

“KALOC MINAMIROKUGO” in Ota City, Tokyo, were successively completed in October 2024 and January 2025,

respectively. Leveraging our strength in handling the entire process from planning and development to design and

construction, we propose facilities designed for tenant convenience, such as installing numerous freight elevators.

Kajima plans to continue expanding the brand.

A message from the Core5 founders: A team with in-depth expertise in regional market trends is essential to success

Since our founding, we have narrowed our business model to focus solely on industrial development, increasing our concentration on the higher margin and

most profitable portion of the business. Historically, our primary development targets were distribution facilities of about 25,000 m

for retailers. As

2

e-commerce has now become the market driver, we also cater to diverse key demands in the supply chain, such as core logistics hubs over 100,000 m

2

and last-mile distribution facilities close to city centers. A major strength for Core5 is

that we can leverage the creditworthiness of our parent company, KUSA. This means we do not need to rely on raising third-party equity for each transaction

and can acquire land and begin development at the optimal time. Furthermore, in each region where we operate, we hire experienced and capable talent who

understand Core5’s operating principles. As a result, I am proud that our company and our employees share the same values and goals.

The current instability in the political and economic environment has slowed the industrial market’s return to equilibrium and stability. However, I am

confident that Core5 is well-suited to weather any storms, thanks to our experienced team members who are strategically located to understand the

markets in which we operate.

The resilient nature of the business is also explained by the careful timing of new starts in line with changes in the

economic cycle. Having witnessed sharp declines in warehouse demand during events such as the dot-com bubble collapse

and the 2008 financial crisis, Core5 takes a disciplined approach to underwriting each new project. It carefully

analyzes supply-demand dynamics in individual submarkets and closely tracks the leasing and sales performance of its

existing portfolio.

Regional platforms

The key driving force behind Kajima’s industrial property development is Core5 Industrial Partners (Core5),

headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Established in 2015 by those who had played major roles in industrial development

business under Kajima U.S.A. (KUSA) for more than 20 years,

Core5 has developed approximately 4.92 million m

2

of new space over the last 10 years.

One of the primary drivers of our growth so far has been our key regional directors, who have deep-rooted local

networks. In addition to its Head Office, Core5 has four regional offices in key logistics hubs: California, Texas, Ohio

and Pennsylvania. Supported by KUSA’s solid balance sheet,

Core5 has set a strong development track record in each region, where seasoned experts align with local needs to build

a resilient and effective business platform. Thanks to the programmatic nature of its business, Core5 has earned the

trust of local partners, including property agents and general contractors, granting access to valuable first-hand information

on future development sites.

## A merchant development business model

Industrial properties in the U.S. are typically single-story buildings, and their construction timelines are generally shorter than those of office buildings or multifamily residential complexes. Core5 has established a merchant development business model featuring a construction period of approximately 10 months from land acquisition to building delivery, with a full investment cycle of about three years to recycle capital for future projects. As a result, Core5 has established a strong presence in key industrial markets, exemplified by its top-three ranking as a commercial real estate developer in Atlanta during 2020–2021. For the three years starting from FY2022, Core5 has solidified a highly profitable structure with cumulative revenues of over ¥270 billion and net income of over ¥45 billion, leading the growth of Kajima's overseas real estate development business.

In Europe, we began a joint venture with Panattoni Europe in 2016. Panattoni, known as a repeated client of our construction division in Eastern European countries, has also become our partner in the development field. We are working on projects in seven countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy. To date, we have undertaken 34 development projects and sold 20 of them (as of March 31, 2025), putting the business on a growth trajectory.

In Southeast Asia, a hub for manufacturing, we launched the industrial real estate brand Core5 Vietnam in 2022. Targeting the high-demand market for rental factories, we are leveraging the track record and creditworthiness of our U.S. industrial development to develop three properties in the northern port cities such as Haiphong and Quang Ninh. We also have a cold storage warehouse under development in Singapore, and in 2024, we started the development of our first project in Melbourne, Australia.

While market entry strategies vary across geographies, we are advancing our merchant development in industrial properties through strategic partnerships with local professionals. Global expansion will remain a key focus, helping us boost profit and optimize investment returns.

## Entering the domestic market with the KALOC brand

As demand for logistics warehouses grows in Japan, Kajima has entered the market under the "KALOC"* brand to meet logistics needs in urban and suburban areas. The initial projects, "KALOC TOMIYA" in Tomiya City, Miyagi and "KALOC MINAMIROKUGO" in Ota City, Tokyo, were successively completed in October 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Leveraging our strength in handling the entire process from planning and development to design and construction, we propose facilities designed for tenant convenience, such as installing numerous freight elevators. Kajima plans to continue expanding the brand.

## A message from the Core5 founders: A team with in-depth expertise in regional market trends is essential to success

Since our founding, we have narrowed our business model to focus solely on industrial development, increasing our concentration on the higher margin and most profitable portion of the business. Historically, our primary development targets were distribution facilities of about 25,000 m 2 for retailers. As e-commerce has now become the market driver, we also cater to diverse key demands in the supply chain, such as core logistics hubs over 100,000 m 2 and last-mile distribution facilities close to city centers. A major strength for Core5 is that we can leverage the creditworthiness of our parent company, KUSA. This means we do not need to rely on raising third-party equity for each transaction and can acquire land and begin development at the optimal time. Furthermore, in each region where we operate, we hire experienced and capable talent who understand Core5's operating principles. As a result, I am proud that our company and our employees share the same values and goals.

The current instability in the political and economic environment has slowed the industrial market's return to equilibrium and stability. However, I am confident that Core5 is well-suited to weather any storms, thanks to our experienced team members who are strategically located to understand the markets in which we operate.

## The future of smart wellness as envisioned by The GEAR Feature 3

Kajima is engaged in the R&amp;D of smart buildings that use AI and IoT to conserve energy and create comfortable environments. At our Asian regional headquarters called The GEAR (Kajima Lab for Global Engineering, Architecture &amp; Real Estate), which opened in Singapore in August 2023, we are positioning the entire building as a living laboratory. We have begun collecting, storing and analyzing vast amounts of data, from indoor temperature and lighting to occupant behavior and biometric information. We explored the future of smart buildings at the forefront of R&amp;D, a future that goes beyond energy conservation, carbon neutrality, and efficient building management to promote the mental and physical wellness of every individual.

## Kind to people, the environment and society

"How about going to the SKY GARDEN?" While an employee at The GEAR is busy working at their computer, a message arrives on one ' s smartphone. The message was sent by an AI that analyzed data from in-house behavior-tracking cameras and ring-type vital sensors after determining that the employee's stress level was increasing due to a long period of focused work and that one ' s social indicator was declining. The message suggests moving to the open, green shared space, encouraging the employee to relax and interact with colleagues.

Combining the functions of Kajima's Asia Head Office with an R&amp;D center and an open innovation hub, we designed The GEAR to be a smart building that is kind to its occupants, the environment, and society, incorporating many advanced designs and initiatives. In addition to smartphone messages based on nudge theory, which guides behavior based on human characteristics and psychology, The GEAR strives to balance comfort and energy efficiency by considering even subconscious fatigue and discomfort. This is achieved through features such as an automated control system that analyzes foot traffic with AI to optimize HVAC and lighting, and an atrium space illuminated solely by natural light while blocking direct sunlight.

Furthermore, in Co.worXlab, an office space jointly established with Electric Works Company, Panasonic Corporation, we are demonstrating systems that enhance intellectual productivity. This includes a conference room that stimulates discussion by instantly analyzing video and audio data during meetings and controlling the HVAC, lighting, airflow, and aroma accordingly.

## Storing over 9,000 types of data

These initiatives are supported by sensing devices. More than 2,700 devices—including facial recognition cameras that can read emotions and air quality sensors that detect airborne particles—have been installed throughout the building, which has six floors above ground and one below. Each device measures about three to four different items, meaning that over 9,000 types of data are visualized and stored daily.

The GEAR has obtained the highest rank in the international environmental performance standard for buildings and districts focused on human health: WELL Certification Platinum. In 2025, it also achieved the highest rank of smart buildings, SmartScore Platinum. This achievement is the result of not only its design specifications but also its operational initiatives, such as indoor environmental monitoring and data visualization.

Kajima decided to use The GEAR as a living laboratory because of Singapore's proactive policies and culture of promoting innovation. Under the "Smart Nation" initiative announced by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2014, digitalization has advanced in various fields, including government services, infrastructure management and payment systems. The government is promoting open data by sharing approved administrative data with the private sector and is launching successive support measures for startups and R&amp;D centers.

Since establishing its Southeast Asia regional headquarters in Singapore in 1988, Kajima has built a solid track record in local construction and real estate development, and in 2013, it established the Kajima Technical Research Institute Singapore (KaTRIS). Since its integration into The GEAR, KaTRIS has been leveraging the local culture's deep understanding of open data to build and analyze big data, including human behavior and biometric information.

ventilation can reduce energy consumption by 86–94%

compared to when air conditioning is running.

Based on these verification results, KaTRIS aims to expand the concept of semi-outdoor offices to other Southeast Asian

countries and Japan. By understanding societal needs and incorporating cutting-edge technology, Kajima will continue to

realize ever-evolving smart buildings.

I am researching environmental performance and well-being, and I hope to expand the possibilities for designing comfortable, naturally ventilated, and semi-outdoor spaces that don’t

We are implementing a financial strategy aimed at further enhancing corporate value and market valuation.

## Review of FY2024 and our outlook for the future

In the first year of the Kajima Group Medium-Term Business Plan (2024–2026), we achieved our fourth consecutive year of increased revenue and profit, delivering record-high revenue of ¥2,911.8 billion and our second-highest net income of ¥125.8 billion. By maintaining an ROE above 10%, we assess that our Group continues to deliver the profit growth and capital efficiency we aim for. Furthermore, our earnings per share (EPS) and stock price have continued to show steady improvement.

Looking back at recent business trends, the domestic construction business faced several challenges, including rising construction costs and compliance with new overtime regulations. However, due to detailed pre-contract planning, contracts with appropriate terms, and ongoing efforts to improve productivity during construction, we achieved profits that exceeded our initial plan.

In our real estate development business, although both domestic and overseas markets experienced shifts in financial conditions, our domestic operations showed relatively stable progress. In overseas markets like the U.S., where policy trends remain uncertain, we determined that the environment required careful consideration of the timing for both investments and asset sales. Despite this challenging environment, our overseas business as a whole has recorded profits above a certain level, regardless of recent fluctuations, and has grown into a reliable pillar of earnings.

For FY2025, we are forecasting record highs for both consolidated revenue and net income, projected at ¥2,950

billion and ¥130 billion, respectively. This is based on factors such as the large number of domestic civil engineering projects reaching their peak, the enhancement of profitability within domestic building construction, and an anticipated recovery in overseas performance as markets rebound.

## Domestic construction business

Domestic construction demand remains robust, with a steady pipeline of projects expected over the next four to five years. However, from a sustainability perspective in the construction business, numerous challenges remain to be addressed, such as securing a future workforce and improving productivity. This requires continuous investment and, crucially, a stable source of investment capital (i.e., gross construction profit).

One of our key priorities is investing in human capital, which focuses not only on wages, training, and working conditions for our Group employees but also on the skilled workers of our partner companies, who are the ones actually carrying out the construction. Enhancing conditions for skilled workers is essential for creating a sustainable construction industry—an urgent priority amid growing labor shortages. We expect these efforts to also help us maintain and strengthen our own construction capabilities over the medium- to long-term.

Furthermore, as a technology-based company, we believe ongoing investment in technology remains indispensable. In addition to R&amp;D in advanced technologies, optimal construction methods, and eco-friendly materials, we are continuing to invest in measures that address labor shortages and the transfer of skills, such as reducing

labor requirements, increasing efficiency, and improving visualization in on-site operations.

As the pace of digitalization accelerates, we believe it is valuable to pursue technology development not only with internal resources but also by investing in startups and other companies to gain new, efficient perspectives. We are actively seeking collaboration partners both in Japan and overseas.

The costs associated with these initiatives are gradually increasing, with most recorded as selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses. To cover these costs and secure operating income, we recognize the importance of increasing both our revenue and construction gross profit margin.

To improve the margin, efforts can be made on both the price and cost sides. While we are, of course, working to improve production efficiency on the cost side, we must also focus on the price side. Given the anticipated labor shortage, supply-demand constraints, and increasing complexity of technologically advanced projects, we believe this value should be reflected in the price and recognized by our customers.

Along with the recent trend toward larger-scale construction projects and extended construction periods, the resurgence of interest rates in the domestic market has further highlighted the need to resolve issues such as the terms and timing of payment collection from our clients.

In many private-sector projects, payments from clients are heavily weighted toward project completion. In contrast, we pay our partner companies on a monthly basis in accordance with the work completed. This places a heavy financial burden on the prime contractor in the form of accounts receivable.

Strengthening the financial health of our partner companies is essential for a sustainable supply chain, and this fiscal year, we have further accelerated our payments. However, since our cash conversion cycle is getting longer, we continue to urge our clients to make payments according to construction progress.

This issue of payment collection is not unique to Kajima. Addressing issues like price negotiations over rising construction costs and ensuring appropriate construction periods is a significant challenge for the entire construction industry, so we are working toward an industry-wide response.

## Real estate development business

For over six years, we have been actively investing in the real estate business as a core growth strategy. Our profit levels have improved compared to the initial period, and we have steadily expanded the scope of our business in terms of scale, geographic reach, and portfolio. We assess that this progress is in alignment with our growth strategy.

Throughout the Medium-Term Business Plan, our domestic real estate development business will accumulate quality assets while also preparing for upcoming portfolio turnover. In addition to rental and sales income derived from conventional office developments, we aim to generate sales revenue from assets including residential properties, hotels, and logistics facilities.

While gross investment in our overseas development business will increase relative to the last two Medium-Term Business Plans, we anticipate a decrease in net investment due to higher capital recoupment from asset sales. We believe we have entered a phase where the cycle of investment and recoupment is functioning effectively, generating profits.

Business strategies vary across countries and regions, influenced by differences in local business environments and the maturity of real estate sales markets. Our plan focuses on logistics warehouse development, which follows a short-term turnover model, in the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia. This is complemented by sales income from assets such as rental apartments (U.S.), renewable energy facilities (Europe), and hotels (Southeast Asia), along with stable rental income from long-term holdings like mixed-use facilities (Southeast Asia).

To account for varying profitability and cash turnover rates across countries, regions, asset types, and business models, we make project decisions using hurdle rates tailored to each project and key indicators like IRR and NOI yield. During internal committee meetings, we explicitly ask our business divisions to clarify their cash turnover rates and exit strategies for assets.

We also prepare a balance sheet for each business division and monitor their status and outlook from the perspectives of capital efficiency and financial soundness. While our domestic and overseas development businesses differ in market characteristics and business models, we share common standards. For capital efficiency, ROIC must exceed WACC (about 5–6%) and ROE must exceed the cost of equity (about 7–8%). For financial soundness, one of the key criteria is ensuring that the total risk amount of our projects remains below our owners' equity. At times, we instruct our business divisions to consider measures such as managing portfolio turnover or moving assets off the balance sheet to reduce risk and improve capital efficiency. However, considering the possibility of temporary downturns in earnings, business decisions and assessments are conducted with a medium- to long-term perspective, rather than relying on annual results.

## Message from the General Manager of the Treasury Division

## Update on our financial strategy

Since profit growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated when the Medium-Term Business Plan was formulated, we have adjusted our cash allocation for the three-year period. We now plan to allocate our cash inflow of ¥1,500 billion (up ¥100 billion from the initial plan) as follows: about ¥1,270 billion (up ¥70 billion) for growth investments and about ¥230 billion (up ¥30 billion) for stockholder returns.

Through ongoing dialogue with investors, we have heard expectations for an upward revision of our ROE target (above 10% level). In the present phase of accumulating development assets, we believe the current target is appropriate, as our priority is to maintain owners' equity (the denominator of ROE) at a level commensurate with the risk volume of our development assets. Aiming for sustainable growth, we consider that it is more appropriate to increase ROE by continuing initiatives and investments that increase the absolute amount of net income (the numerator) rather than by reducing the risk buffer in our equity through excessive stockholder returns.

## Growth investment

To steadily achieve sustainable profit growth, we are continuously formulating and implementing proactive investment plans.

Looking back at our consolidated net income levels, we noted that profits were around ¥20 billion prior to FY2015. They rose to about ¥70 billion due to improved profitability in the domestic construction business. Subsequently, growth in our real estate development and overseas businesses has allowed us to consistently achieve profits of over ¥100 billion. We are now well-positioned to deliver a record-high profit of ¥130 billion.

## Appropriate capital structure

## Continuous reduction of strategic shareholdings

As a result of our ongoing reduction efforts, our balance of strategic shareholdings at the end of FY2024 accounted for 19.8% of consolidated net assets. We thus achieved our Medium-Term Business Plan target (less than 20% of consolidated net assets until the end of FY2026) two years ahead of schedule. We have recently revised our policy, increasing the three-year sales target (¥50 billion or more) in the Medium-Term Business Plan by ¥20 billion. Under this plan, we now aim to sell approximately ¥50 billion of these shares over the next two years (totaling approximately ¥70 billion during the plan's period).

The Board of Directors quantifies the rationale for holding these shares and makes definitive decisions on whether to hold or sell each individual stock. Even for shares that satisfy our retention criteria, we are continuing to evaluate and recommend reductions in response to market demands and the business environment surrounding our clients.

Separately, for shareholdings other than pure investment, we are investing in startups and other companies to acquire advanced technologies and create new businesses. Although these mainly involve investments in unlisted companies, we will enhance our information disclosure regarding their purpose and status as part of our efforts to improve technological competitiveness and promote open innovation.

## Utilization of interest-bearing debt

This profit growth over the past ten years is partly driven by external factors such as economic tailwinds and government policies. However, we believe that this mainly stems from our growth strategies, which include successful investments in our real estate development and overseas businesses while also strengthening our management foundation through investments in human capital, R&amp;D, and digital technology.

We are managing our finances with an eye on both increasing financial leverage and maintaining financial soundness, targeting a D/E ratio of 0.7x throughout the Medium-Term Business Plan period. In light of factors such as maintaining our credit rating and our active role in real estate development, we have set this target at a level higher than that of a typical construction company but lower than that of a real estate developer.

At the same time, given our current profit levels, we believe we can maintain sufficient financial soundness even if we increase our financial leverage and temporarily exceed the target D/E ratio within a certain range. Therefore, we intend to adopt a flexible approach.

Planning acquisition of own shares based on the sale of strategic shareholdings from FY2024 onward

## Stockholder returns

Over the course of the three-year Medium-Term Business Plan, we expect to provide a total of approximately ¥230 billion in stockholder returns. Based on an estimated total consolidated net income of ¥390 billion over the three years, this equates to a total payout ratio of about 60%. We believe this approach maintains an appropriate balance between growth investments and stockholder returns at our current stage of investing to promote future cash-generating capabilities.

In our current Medium-Term Business Plan, we raised the target dividend payout ratio from 30% to 40%, and in line with this policy, we have now increased dividends for five consecutive fiscal years. The dividend per share has been gradually increased from ¥50 in FY2019 to its current level of ¥104, more than doubling over that period. We are planning a further dividend increase this fiscal year, in line with profit growth, and aim to continue raising dividends in conjunction with earnings expansion.

Acquisition of own shares is drawing attention in the stock market as a flexible means of stockholder returns, and we have been consistently acquiring our own shares since FY2019. Previously, we determined the amount and timing of acquisitions by considering our performance, financial condition, and the business environment. For now, however, we are considering acquiring our own shares based on the proceeds from the sale of strategic shareholdings.

## Management conscious of capital cost and stock price

In conjunction with the release of the financial statements for FY2024, we published our "Action to Implement Management Conscious of Cost of Capital and Stock Price." Page 44

The Board of Directors periodically evaluates the return on capital and the growth potential of both the Group as a whole and each individual business. After receiving reports from the IR department on our market valuation, including details of dialogue with investors, the Board reviews financial strategies such as growth investments and stockholder returns. Our

## Interest-bearing debt / Debt-to-equity ratio

<!-- image -->

outside directors share their opinions from both short-term and medium- to long-term perspectives, looking ahead to the next Medium-Term Business Plan. These opinions cover our balance sheet strategy, risk preparedness, and investment evaluation methods, which are reflected in our plans.

Starting in FY2025, we have added ROE to the performance indicators used for directors' remuneration. Although we already had an indicator for the absolute amount of profit (i.e., net income), this addition demonstrates our management's commitment to further awareness of capital efficiency, a KPI in our Medium-Term Business Plan.

In addition to monitoring the balance sheet of each business division, we have established a management system in which achieving divisional targets contributes to meeting the Group-wide ROE target. We have set ROIC as the target metric for our domestic real estate development business, ROE for the overseas business, and gross profit margin for the domestic construction business, which generally does not require significant amounts of capital.

<!-- image -->

Our PBR, a key stock market indicator, has remained consistently above 1x. We believe this reflects not only the steady progress of our Medium-Term Business Plan but also the market's trust in our performance, supported by our solid track record and timely information disclosure.

However, we also see potential for improving our PER, which serves as an indicator of expectations for profit growth. Each year, we see more opportunities to engage in dialogue with institutional investors, both in Japan and overseas. We will focus on improving the quality of these dialogue and undertake activities that raise expectations for our Group's future potential. Last fiscal year, we also participated in company information sessions for individual investors hosted by securities firms. We found these to be valuable opportunities to explain the Group's strategies and direction while also receiving direct feedback and evaluations. We intend to continue these activities going forward.

We will continue to implement the strategies outlined in our Medium-Term Business Plan to improve profitability and deliver returns to stakeholders based on our performance. At the same time, we will enhance our information disclosure, including on sustainability, and expand dialogue with stakeholders, aiming to further enhance both our market valuation and societal value.

Efforts are being made to respond precisely to the economic conditions in each region and to leverage

platforms in both the construction and real estate development businesses.

Profitability has strengthened steadily through accelerated investment and recoupment cycles.

Steady profit growth is achieved through risk control and by establishing advantages in priority areas.

Note: As the bar graph breakdown shows the net income of each business segment before consolidation adjustments, the total does not match total consolidated net income.

Action to Implement Management Conscious of Cost of Capital and Stock Price

1. Evaluation and analysis of the current situation

•

•

In the Kajima Group Medium-Term Business Plan (2024–2026), we formulated a financial strategy designed to enhance corporate value and market valuation.

The Board of Directors has confirmed and evaluated each business’s capital profitability based on the cost of capital in multiple discussions.

Additionally, financial strategies, including growth investments and shareholder returns, have been reviewed based on an understanding of market evaluations and the results of IR activities.

•

•

•

•

•

FY2024: The improvement of profit margins in the domestic building construction business and expanded sales profits in the real estate development business contributed to consolidated net income of 125.8 billion yen, exceeding the forecast at the beginning of the

period and achieving revenue and income growth for four consecutive years.

FY2025: Steady profit growth in the domestic civil engineering and building construction businesses, along with rising profits at domestic and overseas subsidiaries and affiliates, expected to yield a record-high consolidated net income of 130.0 billion yen. Fiscal 2026 medium-term

business plan target expected to be achieved one year ahead of schedule, with revenues and income up for a fifth consecutive year.

In fiscal 2026 and beyond, we aim to achieve continued profit growth and meet our consolidated net income target of “at least 150.0

billion yen by fiscal 2030,” as set forth in the medium-term business plan, ahead of schedule.

We recognize the Kajima Group’s cost of shareholders’ equity is approx. 7–8%.

ROE for fiscal 2024 was 10.2%, and we expect to maintain a level consistently above 10% beyond fiscal 2025.

We have confirmed that both fiscal 2024 results and fiscal 2025 management targets ensure capital profitability that significantly exceeds the cost of shareholders’ equity.

Since February 2025, when we announced revisions to our fiscal 2024 performance forecasts and increased dividends, our stock price has risen, and PBR has exceeded 1.

We believe this is because financial markets have valued our timely disclosure of performance forecasts and flexible shareholder returns accompanying performance improvements.

2. Future initiatives

•

In light of our accelerating profit growth, we have updated our financial strategy to further enhance corporate value and market valuation.

•

•

While appropriately assessing the changing business environment, we will implement measures and investments to grow and enhance shareholder returns.

Furthermore, to gain trust and positive valuation from financial markets, we will continue to strengthen timely disclosure and dialogue concerning management policies, including performance forecasts.

investment and recoupment cycles in the domestic and overseas real estate development businesses.

Total investment for three years is planned for 70.0 billion yen over the plan. Recoupment through development asset sales will be up

40.0 billion yen.

ROE will be maintained at a level exceeding 10%.

Strategic shareholdings achieved the target of “less than 20% of consolidated net assets by the end of fiscal 2026” as of the end of

FY2024. We will continue reduction in fiscal 2025 and beyond, aiming to increase the sales amount over three years by approx. 20.0

billion yen over the plan.

The D/E ratio target will be maintained at approx. 0.7.

With a target dividend payout ratio of 40%, we aim to increase dividends in line with profit growth.

Continue share buybacks with an awareness of improving capital efficiency and enhancing shareholder returns. For the time being, we will flexibly implement share buybacks based on the results of strategic shareholding sales. We plan to repurchase 20.0 billion yen of our

own shares in fiscal 2025. (Strategic shareholding sales in fiscal 2024 amounted to 20.3 billion yen.)

The total amount of shareholder returns over three years has been expanded by approx. 30.0 billion yen over the plan.

ROE has been adopted as an evaluation criterion for executive compensation for fiscal 2025 and beyond.

Timely information disclosure and dialogue with investors and the market regarding management policies will continue to be strengthened.

## Material Issues

## Identifying and revising the Kajima Group's material issues

In July 2019, the Kajima Group mapped social issues on two axes: their impact on society and their importance to the Group. We then consolidated and reorganized the issues identified as having a high impact and major importance. We identified seven material issues: four to which we contribute through our business, and three that form the foundation for business sustainability. We have clarified the relationship between our material issues and the SDGs adopted by the United Nations. Page 46

## Process for revising material issues

<!-- image -->

We have regularly revised these issues since then in light of changes in the social and business environment. In FY2023, alongside deliberations on our Medium-Term Business Plan (2024–2026) and the Kajima Environmental Vision 2050plus, we reviewed our material issues based on input from external experts. As a result, we updated some issues in 2024, including those related to the environment.

We have also linked these issues to the growth strategies of our Medium-Term Business Plan (2024–2026), setting specific measures and KPIs to promote sustainable growth and enhance our corporate value over the medium to long term.

## Market environment

## Priority areas

## Energy facilities

- The 7th Strategic Energy Plan aims to establish a power supply structure that achieves stable energy supply and decarbonization.
- Renewable energy, as well as the restart and back end processes (including final disposal) of nuclear power plants, has been further accelerated.

## Expressway renewal business

- Demand for renewal remains strong as the number of expressways that have been in service for 40 years or more increases.
- There is a growing customer demand for new technologies and construction methods to reduce social loss caused by lane restrictions.

## Ongoing areas

## Dams, roads, railways, bridges, water and sewage facilities, other

- The business scale of the next five-year national resilience plan, which will start in FY2026, is expected to be a little over 20 trillion yen, including the development and management of disaster preparedness infrastructure and strengthening of utilities.
- As demand for the development of social infrastructure in Japan has shown a steady growth, we are proceeding with strategic maintenance and renewal with a clear priority order and other details to ensure the soundness of critical infrastructure.

## Review of FY2024

In FY2024, financial results continued to remain at a high level, following FY2023, as multiple major projects made steady progress. Despite the ongoing busy period, the limit on overtime work—our greatest concern—was put into effect. However, through systematic company-wide efforts, no major disruptions occurred, and progress was made in reducing overtime hours. The order volume is also robust as a result of steady initiatives, such as the acquisition of preferential negotiating rights for technical cooperation in Route 169 Kamikehara Tunnel construction (Nara) ordered by Kinki Regional Development Bureau using the ECI method* and the contract for the Taipei MRT North Circular Line CF690B

## Business policies

As of March 31, 2025, Kajima's revenues and profit for 108 domestic subsidiaries and affiliates (51 subsidiaries *2 and 57 affiliates) tend to fluctuate due to property sales by development-related subsidiaries. However, Kajima's core businesses, such as building construction and civil engineering, have remained solid. For FY2025, we expect higher revenues and profit driven by planned property sales from development-related subsidiaries.

A technical trading company that helps contribute to construction sites through technology and products: Taiko Trading

Founded in 1947, Taiko Trading operates its core businesses in merchandise sales, temporary materials leasing, and construction.

As part of its temporary materials leasing business, the company oversaw integrated management, including planning,

drawing, transportation, and on-site operation, during the

construction of Rapidus IIM-1 . By establishing a 
Page 25

permanent on-site management system, it secured a huge supply of temporary materials and fulfilled the need for prompt

delivery to designated locations across the large site.

From the planning stage, the company took part in the project and collaborated with Kajima to formulate

procurement plans for temporary materials. It conducted the work by leveraging the experience gained from the integrated

management of temporary materials in previous large semiconductor plant projects.

Anticipating a shortage of temporary steel materials and shoring, we identified the required quantities at an early stage

and secured maritime transportation from Honshu. This proactive approach reduced dependence on truck shipments,

which in turn delivered substantial cost savings and alleviated

For deliveries to and from the site, dedicated vehicles were provided for the project. A temporary yard was set up near the

construction site to store procured temporary materials, and to temporarily hold and sort those removed from the site.

Through strong organizational capabilities, it contributed significantly to the project’s on-time completion by coordinating

with local partner companies, transport operators, and leasing firms to meet site needs. Its procurement capabilities enabled

the sourcing of a wide range of temporary materials from across regions

## Research &amp; Technology Development

## Kajima R&amp;D system

Kajima was the first in the construction industry to establish a Technical Research Institute in 1949. In 1956, it was relocated to Chofu, Tokyo, and has since developed a wide range of experimental facilities, including a large shaking table and an ocean engineering laboratory, accumulating advanced technologies to meet the needs of society and customers with an enterprising spirit. The outstanding technologies accumulated over the years are a source of Kajima's competitiveness.

Amid accelerating changes in the global economy and society, and the rapid advancement of digital technologies such as AI, we are enhancing our R&amp;D framework to promote innovation through global collaboration and co-creation. This framework is centered on three major research and development hubs: the Technical Research Institute in Japan; The GEAR, the current base of operations for KaTRIS, which was established in Singapore in 2013; and our informationgathering hub for innovation in Silicon Valley, United States.

## R&amp;D promotion structure

<!-- image -->

## · Formulation and selection of R&amp;D themes

The Research and Technology Development Strategy Meeting sets policies for applied research and development in civil engineering and building construction, as well as basic research (Fundamental R&amp;D), thereby building a framework to deliver highly competitive technologies. Top-down themes are set based on socio-economic trends, emerging social issues and industry challenges. At the same time, bottom-up themes are developed from issues at construction sites and projectspecific challenges. These are planned with both short-term and long-term perspectives, balancing applied R&amp;D themes and basic research themes. This process also incorporates information on innovation from global bases and new perspectives through the use of IP landscape* analysis.

* IP landscape: activities to visualize and analyze intellectual property-related information, and to share the results when formulating business and R&amp;D policies.

## Promotion of intellectual property activities

Kajima's intellectual property activities aim to protect, as intellectual assets, the results of pioneering R&amp;D that anticipates social needs, along with the ideas, knowledge, experience, data and know-how generated during their implementation. These activities are conducted in coordination with business and R&amp;D strategies, to establish competitive advantage and secure collaborative partners. In practice, important matters related to intellectual property are reported to the Board of Directors or the Management Committee. Policies and initiatives concerning the Group's intellectual capital are determined by the Intellectual Property Promotion Meeting, whose members include management and department heads.

The Intellectual Property and License Department, which serves as the secretariat of the meeting, works on filing and securing rights to new intellectual property within the company, managing contracts related to IP, resolving disputes, and raising awareness and developing human resources to reduce litigation risks. It also conducts IP landscape activities that utilize IP-related information for business development and R&amp;D activities.

## · Awareness and human resources development in intellectual property

Since 2022, the building construction business has appointed IP key persons at each branch. They serve as contact points to facilitate the smooth conversion of on-site ingenuity into rights and to detect risks of potential infringement at an early stage, thereby raising engineers' awareness of intellectual property.

Education on intellectual property is also provided on an ongoing basis, in the form of online courses open to employees. In addition, an internal commendation system has been established, under which the President awards inventions that have made outstanding contributions to business or recognizes young and mid-career inventors with promising futures in the field of intellectual property.

## · Participation in global platforms for intellectual property

Since 2022, Kajima has participated as a partner in WIPO GREEN, a platform operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to promote environmental technologies and innovation. At present, ECM Concrete, CUCO-SUICOM, and Coral Net have been registered, and we expect to collaborate with external parties.

## FY 2024 research and technology development fields

To provide comprehensive solutions, Kajima classifies its research and technology development fields into six categories: Disaster prevention and mitigation, Life cycle, Well-being and smart buildings, Green and circular economy, Automation and digitalization, and Construction and structural methods. In the core business of construction, in addition to developing and verifying new technologies tailored to individual projects that we have long pursued,

In addition, we are dedicated to advancing well-being technologies focused on health, happiness, and spatial quality, along with R&amp;D related to the circular economy to support a decarbonized future.

## Research &amp; Technology Development

## Green and circular economy (carbon neutrality)

## CO2-SUICOM: From decarbonization to carbon utilization: Achieving a circular economy

<!-- image -->

Since joining Kajima in 2005 after studying concrete in university and graduate school, I have been engaged in research and development involving concrete and CO2 at the Kajima Technical Research Institute. From 2013, I spent three years at two dam construction sites in Kyushu, where I gained opportunity in dam concrete placement and quality control, as well as applying new types of concrete on site. Based on that experience, I returned to the Technical Research Institute nine years ago, where I have been pursuing research aimed at technologies that generate synergies among structure, materials and construction. I am researching and developing CO2-SUICOM, which addresses the issue of conventional concrete generating large amounts of CO2 during production. At Kajima, we are working to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of buildings in the design and construction processes. By also focusing on individual materials, we believe we can contribute not only to decarbonization but also to achieving a circular economy.

Takeshi Torichigai Chief Research Engineer, Concrete and Construction Materials Group, Kajima Technical Research Institute

Developed in 2008 together with Chugoku Electric Power and Denka, the first technology of its kind in the world, CO2-SUICOM is now being expanded to society through partnerships, starting with Landes, a concrete product manufacturer, and further collaboration with a wider range of companies. Currently, the cost of CO2-SUICOM is about three times that of conventional concrete. By increasing the number of manufacturers willing to produce it and expanding the market, Kajima aims to enhance its environmental performance while also addressing its economic viability through greater versatility. Going beyond carbon neutrality through CO2 absorption, the goal is to achieve "carbon utilization."

## Automation and digitalization (DX)

## A4
CSEL: Creating construction sites where diverse workers can participate

I have been engaged in research and development related to measurement and system control, particularly the design and implementation of automation systems for construction machinery for nearly 25 years since joining Kajima. Since 2009, I have been working on the research and development of A 4 CSEL, an automated construction system for heavy machinery.

In Japan's construction industry, the aging of skilled workers and the shortage of personnel are pressing issues, with improving productivity being a particularly major challenge. Human work inevitably leads to variations in progress and quality due to differences in the skills and experience of individual workers. However, by standardizing these tasks based on the movements of veteran operators and automating them to achieve consistent precision, we can ensure quality regardless of who performs the work or where it is done, thereby improving productivity. To achieve this, I began by learning the construction work performed at construction sites and incorporated the acquired expertise into automated construction machinery. Automated construction is now operational at dam sites. Going forward, we aim to create further value, not only by expanding the scope of construction sites where our solutions can be applied, but also by looking toward overseas expansion and space exploration.

In recent years, as technologies such as ICT and generative AI have advanced, I believe my expertise lies in approaching civil engineering and construction knowledge from the perspective of mechanical, electrical, and information engineering specializations, enabling new approaches. For example, as automated construction progresses, the importance of work procedures and setup will increase relative to the operational expertise previously required. Furthermore, the realization of remote management will enable the participation of diverse talent regardless of their physical location. We will continue to engage in research and development that contributes to our corporate mission and society by supporting social infrastructure through construction sites where diverse talents can participate.

## Seismic damping technology

Kajima was one of the first in the industry to begin research on seismic damping and base isolation, and after completing the world's first seismic damping building, the company put a variety of research outcomes into practical application, including Japan's first high-rise building, the Kasumigaseki Building.

In 2013, we developed D³SKY, a seismic damping device for high-rise buildings, and has since applied it in multiple projects.

In 2023, we introduced a new seismic damping control-layer structure, KaCLASS, designed to significantly reduce long-period ground motion-induced shaking of entire high-rise buildings compared with conventional seismic and vibration-control frames. It is currently being implemented in ongoing projects.

We will contribute to the creation of safe and secure living environments.

## FY2024 National Commendation for Invention—Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award

In the FY2024 National Commendation for Invention, Kajima's HiDAX-R seismic oil damper technology, which is installed between building floors to reduce shaking, received both the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award and the Invention Implementation Achievement Award.

In 1986, Kajima became the first in the industry to establish an Acoustic Research Building at its Institute. Since then, the company has developed simulation technologies to support the design of advanced acoustic spaces and jointly developed the 3D sound reproduction technology "OPSODIS" with the University of Southampton in the U.K., contributing to the design and construction of numerous concert halls and other facilities.

Within the Acoustic Research Building, we established an anechoic chamber, an acoustic testing room designed to minimize reflected sound. A key to development has been accurately understanding the acoustic characteristics of walls, floors and ceilings of various shapes and materials, as well as the transmission properties of sound arriving at the human ear from multiple directions. Recently, we developed technologies to further enhance the performance of the anechoic chamber and renovated the facility in January 2025, achieving extreme levels of anechoic performance. Page 42

## Total engineering services for flooding disasters

Kajima offers Total Engineering Services for Flooding Disasters, providing one-stop solutions from risk assessment and countermeasure planning to construction and operational support.

In 2023, we began examining rational flood countermeasures for the Nishichofu Complex of the Kajima Technical Research Institute. This study took into account the increasing flood risks due to climate change, the potential direct damage in the event of flooding at the site, and the operational impact associated with suspension of experiments. The study was completed in June 2025. Going forward, we will review and update the action timelines through BCP training and similar exercises, while also strengthening them as solutions provided to our customers.

In addition, we will continue to expand our BCP support— which has long addressed earthquakes, wind, and fire—to incorporate flood countermeasures. By combining software solutions, such as simulations, with hardware measures, including the selection of flood-prevention facilities and consideration of disaster response actions, Kajima aims to provide comprehensive and rational one-stop services for various disaster risks.

## Human Resources Strategy

## Human resources strategy overview

The Kajima corporate philosophy advocates "As a group of individuals working together as one, we pursue creative progress and development founded on both rational, scientific principles and a humanitarian outlook, through which we strive to continually advance our business operations and contribute to society." This spirit of humanitarianism and valuing people is a cornerstone of our competitive advantage.

Since its founding, Kajima has consistently embraced an enterprising spirit, taking on projects that look ahead of the times, such as railways and skyscraper construction. Moving forward, we aim to be a vibrant corporate group where each individual keenly senses the changing times, fully utilizes their capabilities, and takes pride in being a part of the Kajima Group.

In our vision, we have identified two key elements related to people: an engaging workplace where diverse individuals leverage their unique talents and an environment where every individual continually takes the initiative to embrace new challenges.

In recent years, while strong construction demand has continued, resource supply has been constrained, and we have been working to adapt to the legal limit on overtime hours, which came into full effect in FY2024. At the same time, acquiring talent, accelerating the development of the next generation, and strengthening the management skills of mid-career employees have become urgent tasks. We view these changes as opportunities to promote flexible work styles and enhance corporate attractiveness, thereby accelerating our human capital strategy.

The following sections present Kajima's human resources strategy for developing talent and systems to promote growth and transformation built on three pillars: (1) talent acquisition and retention to support our domestic construction business, growth areas, and technological development; (2) talent development to unlock their potential; (3) improving engagement through DE&amp;I, health and productivity management, and workstyle reforms.

## Our Goals

<!-- image -->

## Message from the General Manager of the Human Resources Department

Passing on a culture of valuing people Maximizing the value of diverse human capital

## Naoshi Nishizawa

Executive Officer, General Manager of Human Resources Department

At Kajima, our value creation is rooted in people—empowered by a field-centric philosophy and a deep-seated pride in our identity as a technology-driven enterprise. The "field" encompasses not only construction sites for civil engineering and architectural projects, but also every domain of strategic challenge—including R&amp;D, real estate development, design, operations, and maintenance. Human capital is maximized when each employee identifies their unique contribution and performs with a sense of purpose and pride. Moreover, the foundation of Kajima's identity as a technology-driven enterprise lies in the accumulation of knowledge, skills, and experience built up over 180 years, with employees continuously challenging and inspiring one another, fostering a culture of excellence in pursuit of shared goals. Creating an environment where diverse individuals can grow with confidence over the long term is a strategic mandate of the Human Resources Department.

Looking ahead, generational shifts are expected to significantly reshape the age structure of our workforce. It is imperative to empower mid-career professionals to assume leadership roles, while cultivating an environment where emerging young talent can accelerate their growth trajectory. To support this initiative, we are enhancing career interviews and mentoring systems, alongside training programs that support on-the-job development at worksites—providing growth support tailored to each employee. We are also broadening opportunities for self-directed development, fostering reflection and self-awareness, and nurturing a culture where employees proactively shape their professional journeys.

With overseas operations now accounting for approximately 40% of revenues and foreign direct investment increasing in Japan, building a globally agile workforce equipped to thrive in cross-border business environments is essential. We are expanding overseas training programs and planning to double the number of young employees dispatched abroad.

In 2024, we accelerated our DE&amp;I initiatives by raising the

<!-- image -->

hiring target for female career-track graduates from 20% to 30%. We are also working to foster an inclusive and equitable workplace that embraces diversity across age, ability, and background.

We regard career breaks due to childcare, eldercare, or spousal relocation not merely as personal matters, but as opportunities for organizational learning and insight into broader social challenges. Accordingly, we are enhancing support systems for work-life integration and have established comeback programs and leave schemes for accompanying spouses.

The engagement survey introduced in FY 2023 revealed that trust in the workplace increases employee motivation, sense of growth, and confidence in management. Morinosuke Kajima, often described as the key figure behind Kajima's postwar resurgence, once said, "To bring people together, you must have love. Without love, you cannot keep them." Last year's survey score exceeded the results from the first year of implementation. Going forward, we remain committed to preserving our people-centric culture and continuously elevating engagement as a strategic priority.

## Projected composition ratios of career-track and specialized employees by generation

## Talent acquisition and retention

Strengthening recruitment and employment to maintain and enhance production capacity

## Reinforcing new graduate hiring

Kajima's recruitment policy emphasizes the consistent and sustainable acquisition and retention of high-potential talent capable of inheriting the knowledge, skills, values, and trust cultivated over many years from clients, and shaping the future of Kajima.

## Active roles for experienced and senior employees

In addition to talent who will play central roles in construction and real estate development businesses, we are actively recruiting diverse professionals, including specialists equipped to respond to increasingly advanced technologies and individuals who can flexibly adapt to globalization and rapid change. Reflecting the medium- to long-term scale of operations and workforce composition, as well as compliance with the legal limit on overtime work, we have recently expanded the hiring framework for new graduates to around 400, as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen the talent base essential for the sustainable growth of our businesses.

At the same time, due to factors such as Japan's declining birthrate, the number of applicants for certain technical positions has stagnated. In response, we are undertaking multifaceted initiatives, such as hosting outreach events for students (approx. 3,700 participants), accepting interns (approx. 100), hosting both online and in-person promotional events, and conducting site visits to civil engineering and building worksites, the Kajima Technical Research Institute, and the Kajima Technical Center (approx. 500).

Considering the geographical characteristics of the construction industry, where work sites are spread across wide areas, we are also focusing on hiring individuals who can contribute locally over the long term. In 2024, we launched a new graduate hiring track for specialized positions, previously limited to mid-career recruitment, attracting applicants from high school to graduate level who aspired to work in their hometowns or local communities, with 63 joining Kajima.

Kajima actively recruits individuals with specialized expertise and practical experience in strategic areas such as engineering, automated construction and robotics, and overseas business, while also bringing in external perspectives. We also appoint professionals to specialized roles and conduct mid-career hiring to support community-based operations. To support employees who wish to continue working beyond the mandatory retirement age of 60, we offer re-employment programs and a supportive work environment. The re-employment rate is approximately 90%, and the rate for those who wish to be rehired is 100%.

In passing on technical expertise, it is essential to transfer on-site knowledge across generations. Senior employees with long-standing frontline experience play a vital role in developing the next generation and preserving skills and corporate culture—contributing to sustainable growth and value creation.

## Talent development

## Fostering a culture of self-directed development

Kajima is committed to maximizing the potential of its talent by developing individuals who possess both advanced expertise to meet the changing expectations of society and clients, and the management capabilities required for effective organizational operations and project execution.

For new graduates, we designate the first 13 years after joining the company as a focused development period for acquiring specialized knowledge. We provide OJT and job rotations to broaden experience, while also offering structured group training (OFF-JT) tailored to job category and year of entry, supporting their growth into fully capable engineers and business professionals. We also assign employees who have demonstrated strong results in Japan to overseas subsidiaries, to promote further growth through tough assignments. In FY2024, 12 employees were dispatched overseas, bringing the cumulative total to 113 over the past ten years.

For managers, we conduct training in four tiers according to position, with approximately 600 participants annually. In addition to improving management capabilities, we have expanded training content to cover changes in social conditions, DE&amp;I, and engagement. This reflects our recognition that transforming managerial awareness is

## Employee education and training system

<!-- image -->

essential for creating workplaces that respect diverse values and enable each employee to fully realize their potential.

Furthermore, we are building an environment that supports employees' autonomous and self-directed growth. From FY2024, we launched a "Skill-Up" section on the company intranet that consolidates business skills, digital and IT learning videos, job-specific training materials, and knowledge resources. A total of 46,135 employees accessed this platform. We also provide programs for studying at domestic and overseas graduate schools and short-term business schools, as well as support for acquiring qualifications and language skills, thereby promoting both a tangible sense of growth and improved productivity.

In Toshima-ku, Tokyo, we are renovating and expanding an existing training facility, scheduled to begin operation in spring 2026. Through this structured training, growth opportunities, and support for self-directed learning, we aim to strengthen employee development and organizational vitality.

Looking ahead over the next decade, a key challenge will be enabling younger employees to acquire management capabilities earlier in their careers. To address this, we are expanding our development programs to include new initiatives focused on leadership, alongside our existing specialization-based framework.

## Improving engagement

Promoting flexible workstyles to transform employee mindset and enhance the workplace environment

## Improving engagement

Kajima advances engagement through both systems and dialogue. By responding to employee feedback to enhance workplace environments and work styles, we strengthen organizational vitality and foster mutual trust. We are committed to cultivating workplaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds can fully express their unique strengths and potential, and proactively pursue new challenges. In alignment with this vision, we are advancing initiatives such as Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DE&amp;I), health and productivity management, and work style innovation.

## Promoting DE&amp;I

At Kajima, we are dedicated not only to improving ease of work but also to creating an environment where every employee experiences a sense of purpose and fulfillment. By encouraging mutual respect and learning across differences, we nurture a culture of psychological safety and challenge.

Our longstanding commitment to diversity includes initiatives such as empowering women and promoting childcare leave for male employees. In FY2024, we established the DE&amp;I Promotion Committee under the President-led Sustainability Committee and set new targets: 30% of new graduate hires for career-track positions to be women by FY 2028, 10% of managerial roles to be held by women by FY 2035, 100% of male employees to take childcare leave, with at least 50% taking 30 days or more. To further enhance psychological safety, we are implementing multifaceted measures, including the elimination of discrimination and inequity, and the promotion of employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.

Approximately 70% of our workforce comprises engineers with science and engineering backgrounds. Recognizing the limited number of female students pursuing construction-related academic disciplines, we are actively working to elevate awareness and interest in industry careers through targeted outreach and publicity events for students.

Since initiating the recruitment of female career-track graduates around 20 years ago, the ratio has grown to 9.6%, with a steadily increasing pipeline of future leaders. Since 2015, we have conducted annual career development programs for young female employees, with approximately 50 participants each year. These programs support self-directed career growth through leadership training and engagement with role models.

As part of our work-life integration efforts, we have hosted "Work and Childcare Balance Webinars" since 2015, with approximately 200 participants in 2024. In 2022, we expanded our childcare flex system and telework policies, contributing to a male childcare leave uptake rate of 91.2% in FY2024, with 46.0% taking 30 days or more.

In March 2025, we held "Kajima DE&amp;I Week" in conjunction with International Women's Day. Through video messages from the President, executives, and department and branch heads, we fostered a culture in which each employee takes ownership of advancing DE&amp;I. Survey feedback was highly positive, and we are exploring further initiatives for the coming year.

Improving engagement

Promoting flexible workstyles to transform employee mindset and enhance the workplace environment

## Progress in workstyle reform

Since FY2024, a legal limit on overtime work (45 hours per month) has been applied to the construction industry. Centered on the Work Style Reform Committee chaired by the President, we are promoting a shift towards working styles that deliver outcomes within limited hours.

The success of these reforms depends on adopting construction timelines aligned with a five-day workweek, in close collaboration with clients to make this a reality. Even for private building projects, which often face tight schedules in line with business plans, we secured the equivalent of a five-day workweek (eight closed days per four weeks) for approximately 80% of newly awarded projects in FY2024. For projects under construction, we conducted campaigns to increase closure days, enabling employees to refresh physically and mentally and spend more time with their families.

We also encourage employees to take planned leave so that all staff can secure at least 120 days off per year.

In addition, we continue to promote process streamlining and digitalization. By breaking down tasks, improving and sharing processes, and reallocating work that can be outsourced, we are reducing overtime hours while enhancing productivity.

## Steady promotion of health and productivity management

Kajima regards the physical and mental health of employees as a vital management resource, and promotes health initiatives under the "Kajima Group Health and Productivity Management Declaration." We have been recognized for two consecutive years (six times in total) under the METI's Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization program. At our in-

## Utilization of the engagement survey

Kajima maintains high employee satisfaction and a low turnover rate of approximately 1%. To support sustainable growth and better workplaces, we introduced an engagement survey in FY2023. Survey questions are grouped into five categories, and the combined Kajima Engagement Score is used as a KPI. In FY2024, the score reached 17.65 out of 25 (up from 17.45 in the previous year), with notable improvements in work style-related categories such as "working hours and locations" and "facilities and environment."

The results are shared with senior management, HR, and department heads, and analyzed using qualitative feedback and HR data to identify key issues. These insights inform actions such as workplace interviews and task reviews. From April 2025, the score will also factor into executive bonus calculations. By refining systems and environments based on employee feedback, we aim to enhance psychological safety and organizational vitality.

house clinics, we use a health management system to centrally manage the health information of all employees and provide support from both preventive care and treatment perspectives.

With business sites widely dispersed across Japan, industrial physicians and public health nurses travel to sites to deliver health lectures and consultations, ensuring that employees can work with confidence even in remote locations. Stress check results indicate that we have maintained a favorable "overall health risk" score of 80, below the national average of 100.

In addition, based on the "Mental Health Promotion Plan," we provide company-wide education and training programs such as e-learning on mental health, developmental disabilities, and harassment prevention (FY2024 participation rate: 99.9%). Through these initiatives, we support the well-being of employees and their families and aim to build a foundation for sustainable growth.

## Sustainability Promotion System

## Basic policy

Kajima's corporate philosophy is: "As a group of individuals working together as one, we pursue creative progress and development founded on both rational, scientific principles and a humanitarian outlook, through which we strive to continually advance our business operations and contribute to society." Our basic policy is to act in line with this philosophy as we respond to social and environmental issues and aim to be a corporate group with sustainable growth.

## Sustainability Committee

Kajima has established the Sustainability Committee with the aim of considering and making decisions on sustainability policies and monitoring their progress.

The committee is chaired by the President, and its members include relevant executive officers. It deals with issues related to the global environment, as well as people and society, including ensuring the diversity of human resources, respect for human rights and supply chain management. The committee regularly submits agendas and reports details about discussions and decisions to the Board of Directors based on an annual schedule.

In FY2024, Kajima established the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DE&amp;I) Promotion Committee as a third new subcommittee alongside the Environment Committee and Human Rights Committee.

For the management of sustainability-related risks and other risks, the Compliance and Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the President, covers and verifies every risk and promotes activities according to their importance.

In FY2025, we will continue to address environmental issues, human resources, and the maintenance and strengthening of the supply chain. We plan to check the progress in relation to the roadmap and consider policies for tackling issues and informing external parties while considering social trends.

- The committee reported on human rights issues in the Kajima Group and the supply chain, and decided on a human rights due diligence policy that includes building materials traceability survey, among other matters.
- Based on the topic of securing the future construction workforce, the committee reported on improving compensation including construction technician wages, and closing sites for eight days out of every four-week period. It also confirmed the policy for future initiatives.

## Comments from outside officers at Board of Directors meetings

- Kajima has many excellent technologies and initiatives related to the environment. The company should tell external parties about this more actively.
- Women's opinions are reflected in company management more once the percentage of female employees in the managerial track exceeds 30%. Kajima should consider the management effects of employing women.
- The data of engagement survey responses can be stored, analyzed and effectively used.
- It is extremely useful to approach building materials traceability from the perspective of both human rights and the environment. I hope Kajima will publish details on surveys and results inside and outside the company.
- Closing sites for eight days out of every four-week period is important for boosting the appeal of the construction industry. Kajima should continue these efforts.

## Topics

## Revising the Policy on Safety and Health, the Environment, and Quality

In April 2003, Kajima integrated separate policies on safety and health, the environment, and quality.

In April 2025, Kajima revised the Safety and Health Policy (established in 2003) and the Environmental Policy (revised in 2013) under the Policy on Safety and Health, the Environment, and Quality, in light of changes in measures and the social landscape.

## · Basic Policy

Safety and health, environmental management and quality are fundamental to construction activities and corporate survival. By establishing and continuously improving management systems to comply with relevant laws, ordinances and other social requirements, Kajima works to conduct efficient construction activities while earning the trust of clients and society.

## · Safety and Health Policy

Safety and health are the barometers of a company's capabilities and ethics. Based on this understanding, Kajima proactively works in close cooperation with its partner companies to eliminate construction-related disasters and accidents while aiming to improve workplace safety and health and promote health.

1. Make sure that the Three Reality Principle (Real site, Real things, Real conditions) and Basic Safety Behavior (calling out, on-site risk prediction, and the safety practice of "pointing and calling") are practiced in all worksites.
2. Maintain psychological safety through active communication to provide open working environments in which people can work safely and securely.

## · Environmental Policy

Establish a long-term environmental vision that is shared throughout the company. Aim to create a more sustainable society in which environmental preservation and economic activities can successfully coexist.

1. Work to promote carbon neutrality, circular economy, and nature positivity not only in Kajima's business activities but also across the entire life cycles of structures and local environmental preservation/environmental remediation projects.
2. As common foundations for the above initiatives:
- Promote technological development that contributes to the preservation and sustainable use of the environment.
- Promote preventative management (including voluntary management) of hazardous substances related to the company's business.
- Seek partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders, including the proactive disclosure of information.

## · Quality Policy

Kajima provides products and services that satisfy clients, from marketing to follow-up services, allowing them to place orders with a sense of reassurance and trust.

1. Ensure product quality by responding appropriately to client requirements while thoroughly implementing the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.
2. Promote research and development activities to improve quality and increase operational efficiency.

## Human Rights and Supply Chain

## Basic policy

The Kajima Group established the Kajima Group Human Rights Policy based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is pursuing initiatives to respect human rights under the leadership of the Human Rights Committee. This policy applies to all Kajima Group officers and employees. We also expect our global supply chain partners to understand and endorse the policy, and we actively engage in awareness and educational activities with them.

In addition, we have established the Kajima Group Conduct Guidelines for Business Partners to ensure compliance with laws, respect for human rights, responsibility for the environment, and assurance of quality. Together with our business partners, we promote initiatives to fulfill our social responsibilities.

## Human rights due diligence

The Kajima Group undertook human rights due diligence in FY2021. We conducted human rights due diligence at Kajima Corporation in FY2023 and at 97 domestic and overseas Group companies in FY2024, receiving advice from external experts. As a result, we identified priority human rights risks within the Group, including excessive working hours, harassment, and supply chain-related risks.

## · Initiatives within the Kajima Group

In FY2024, the Kajima Group conducted training on corporate human rights initiatives for directors of our domestic Group companies. We have also continued a human rights awareness program as part of the compliance training for the entire Group. Moving forward, we will focus on the prevention and resolution of identified human rights issues and remain committed to minimizing any potential negative impact of the Kajima Group's business activities on human rights.

## · Collaboration with the supply chain

In April 2024, we published practical guidelines containing the definition of terms, explanations and examples of specific initiatives to explain each of the topics in the Kajima Group Conduct Guidelines for Business Partners. We shared the Practical Handbook with our partner companies and encouraged them to promote further initiatives. We added provisions to the Basic Construction Subcontract Agreement as well as the Purchase Order Terms and Conditions to observe, respect and enforce the Guidelines.

In FY2024, the response rate for our biennial self-check survey reached 76.9%, exceeding that of the previous survey. The survey assesses the progress on 13 key items (including legal compliance, human rights, labor practices, environment, information security, and BCP) among members of the Kajima Business Partners' Association, who account for approximately 60% of our total order value. The survey results and issues were fed back to respondent companies and reported at a Board of Directors meeting and on other occasions.

In FY2025, we will interact with survey respondents to deepen their understanding of the Guidelines and encourage business partners to take initiatives and work to raise effectiveness, for example, by reviewing the contents of the next survey.

## · Building materials traceability survey

Society and customers are increasingly concerned about the traceability of building materials, as well as human rights and environmental issues throughout the supply chain. In FY2024, we established the Building Materials Traceability Sectional Committee within the cross-departmental Supply Chain Working Group to address supply chain issues. This committee identified high-risk raw materials in accordance with the policy set by the Human Rights Committee and the Environment Committee. In FY2025, we plan to conduct a traceability survey on identified high-risk materials such as wood in light of the results of a hearing survey with some business partners. Through dialogue with relevant suppliers and other stakeholders, we aim to identify human rights and environmental risks in processes such as logging, mining, and processing, and to use these insights to guide future initiatives.

## Setting up hotlines (mitigation mechanism)

We set up human rights hotlines for all stakeholders, including suppliers, inside and outside the company. We have also raised awareness of the hotlines at construction sites. We also have a harassment hotline for employees.

## Restructuring multi-layered subcontracting system

Japan's construction industry has long relied on a multi-layered subcontracting system. This structure typically consists of a general contractor overseeing the entire project, with primary, secondary, and lower-tier subcontractors responsible for intermediate construction management, labor provision, and other direct construction functions.

This entrenched multi-layered structure has hindered improvements in productivity, safety, and quality, while also constraining wage growth for skilled workers.

Since FY2021, Kajima has been addressing these issues by reforming the multi-layered subcontracting system. Our focus includes ensuring legal compliance, clarifying construction responsibilities, ensuring thorough safety and quality management, improving the treatment of skilled workers, and enhancing productivity.

Initially, we identified the factors leading to multi-layering and implemented various measures. These included ensuring appropriate construction periods, placing orders in a stable manner, eliminating brokers with little effective involvement, and supporting primary subcontractors' reform initiatives. As a result of these efforts, the situation has significantly improved. We have actively worked to prevent excessive multi-layering in equipment construction, which often requires specialized technology and tends to involve multiple tiers of subcontracting. Consequently, cases where construction systems extended to the fourth tier or lower have been significantly reduced.

By limiting the subcontracting structure to primary and secondary subcontractors, wages and working conditions for skilled workers have improved, making the construction industry more attractive. This improvement is expected to encourage more young people to enter the field. We also believe that this creates a management framework enabling the prime contractor to effectively oversee the entire project. It allows the foreperson of the primary subcontractor to properly supervise those of secondary subcontractors, thereby ensuring that safety and quality are supervised by those best positioned to provide appropriate instruction and guidance.

Since 2022, the proportion of construction systems limited to primary and secondary subcontractors has remained above 90% for civil engineering and around 70% for building construction. This demonstrates that the initiative to restrict multi-layering to the second tier has been steadily embedded in practice. Although the January 2025 survey showed lower ratios than the previous year due to the recent shortage of equipment construction workers and other factors, we will continue our initiatives to maintain a construction system limited to primary and secondary subcontractors.

## Initiatives to secure future workforce

To sustain strong construction capabilities and ensure continued safety and quality, it is essential to work with partner companies to systematically secure and develop human resources. Kajima is advancing initiatives to secure the future workforce of the construction industry.

## · Kajima Partner College

Kajima, in cooperation with the Kajima Business Partners' Association, launched the Kajima Partner College, a training system designed specifically to develop human resources in partner companies. The system includes a Technical Course to train select candidates to become Kajima Meister forepersons and a Management Course for candidates for executive positions. The college aims to cultivate human resources with strong construction management and leadership skills, and a broad perspective of the overall construction industry.

The Technical Course is designed to enhance on-site management skills through hands-on training at Kajima project sites—such as safety patrols and ICT tool workshops—by

## Voice

## Kajima Meister program: Finding motivation and a sense of responsibility

Since March 2024, I have been engaged in steel frame construction management at the site of the Rapidus IIM-1 Construction Project in Chitose City, Hokkaido . Although it was tough to 
Page 25 coordinate to avoid delays in processes and meet an extremely tight schedule, I was recommended by the General Manager and certified as a Kajima Meister in FY2025. I have aspired to obtain this certification, after becoming inspired by a senior employee who was selected as one of the first Meister in the Hokkaido Branch when this program started. I not only feel grateful for the generous incentives but also a strong sense of responsibility when wearing the helmet with the Meister logo. Since subordinates also see me as a Meister, I am committed to monitoring the site more carefully than ever for safety management and efficient construction. I have learned a great deal by working with many people in this large-scale project. I aim to become a Supermeister by leveraging this experience. Page 25

participating in presentations of improvement case studies by partner companies and practicing construction management from the perspective of the prime contractor. The Management Course is a nine-month program where attendees work at Kajima, experiencing construction management at sites where cutting-edge technologies and construction methods are employed, and attending classes in partner educational institutions and events. The costs for attending both courses are covered by Kajima.

In the four years since it was opened in 2021, a total of 79 people has successfully completed the courses (71 graduates from the Technical Course and 8 graduates from the Management Course). Thirteen graduates from the Technical Course have been certified as Kajima Meisters and are now active at Kajima sites. Two graduates from the Management Course have already been appointed as Presidents and now lead their companies by leveraging the knowledge and connections acquired and built at the college, showing steady achievements in developing and maintaining excellent human resources.

Kajima looks forward to helping cultivate and retain talented employees for its partner companies.

## · System to encourage activities for acquiring the next generation of workforce

Established in FY2024, this new system supports members of the Kajima Business Partners' Association and Rokueikai in securing and developing engineers and skilled workers, including subsidies of up to 50% of activity expenses. Ten initiatives were selected in both the first and second rounds.

## · Kajima Meister and E Award

Kajima operates the Kajima Meister program to certify and financially incentivize outstanding forepersons and the E Award to provide monetary rewards for competent young and seasoned skilled workers as initiatives to improve the remuneration and benefits for skilled workers. We set a quota for the number of people under the age of 40 to be selected for the E Award to boost the motivation of young skilled workers.

## Occupational Safety and Health

## Framework for ensuring safety and results in FY2024

Kajima implements safety and health management in conformance with the Construction Occupational Health and Safety Management System (COHSMS).

We review our safety and health policies as necessary based on the performance and circumstances of the previous fiscal year, and then formulate Company-wide safety and health targets and plans for the current fiscal year. Starting from the Company-wide policies formulated through the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, we narrow down the range of issues to determine the priority items to be implemented at individual construction project offices, as well as those for the Head Office, branches and partner companies supporting them. Each project site carries out construction activities in line with these defined priorities.

* Subsidiaries involved in construction

In FY2024, there were 63 occupational accidents (lost work time of 4 or more days) at Kajima construction sites in Japan. The frequency rate of accidents resulting in lost work time of four or more days was 0.74, and the rate for accidents resulting in lost work time of one or more days was 1.47, resulting in a severity rate of 0.29. We will ensure thorough safety management under the slogan "Think safety! Make today accident free."

## Ensuring thorough Basic Safety Behavior

Kajima defines the Three Reality Principle (Real site, Real things, Real conditions), and Basic Safety Behavior (calling out, onsite risk prediction, and the safety practice of "pointing and calling") in its Safety and Health Policy, and it manages safety and health based on these concepts. Over the past two years, we have been focusing on revisiting safety fundamentals and thoroughly implementing Basic Safety Behavior.

This fiscal year, we are taking extra care to reinforce on-site risk prediction. Many past incidents could have been prevented if comprehensive on-site risk prediction measures had been consistently applied by all skilled workers. We will identify highly hazardous tasks through on-site risk prediction and prepare mitigation measures accordingly.

Kajima is also building a system to use its safety knowledge database of incident data and videos in on-site risk prediction. We are reinforcing our workplace incident prevention by ensuring thorough Basic Safety Behavior.

## Starting operations with a mobile hands-on safety training facility

We introduced the Kajima Safety Caravan, a truck-mounted safety training facility to improve the safety awareness and risk sensitivity of all on-site workers. This vehicle is equipped with nine training devices that realistically simulate common hazards, such as falls, machinery entanglement, and electrical accidents. These training sessions are provided for skilled workers who are actively working at construction sites throughout Japan.

Participants have given positive feedback about getting a more realistic experience compared to looking at case study materials, as well as about the importance of simulations. Going forward, we will continue to hold hazard simulation training sessions with the Kajima Safety Caravan, while also improving the content and equipment to further develop this training program.

## Taking on challenges in new renewable energy

Renewable energy is essential for emission reduction at Kajima, though supply may run short in the future. As such, we are considering and pursuing efforts to secure it.

As part of this initiative, we invested in Eavor Technologies Inc., a Canadian startup with closed-loop technology that could be a game-changer in geothermal power.

Closed-loop technology does not require special geological conditions, such as geothermal reservoirs.

Eavor combines this with proprietary fluid-flow regulation in its Eavor‑Loop, aiming to provide baseload power with flexible supply-demand adjustment.

We will continue implementing the following reduction initiatives. [Energy conservation] We will continue initiatives focused on improving productivity at construction sites.

[Decarbonization of electricity] We aim to lead in renewable energy use in Japan and to achieve 100% green electricity globally by FY2030. We will also actively secure our own renewable energy sources to prepare for potential future shortages, while carefully taking costs into account. [Decarbonization of fuel] We will use biofuels for now and shift to synthetic and hydrogen fuels in the future. Due to limited supply and high costs, we began using biofuels with cost-effectiveness in mind. To prepare for large-scale future use, we are conducting trial runs, developing supply routes, and securing long-term purchase rights in cooperation with petroleum wholesalers, startups, and other partners. We are conducting trials with heavy machinery manufacturers to assess the performance, cost, and usability of electric machinery that reduces CO2 emissions. In addition, our subsidiary Kajima Ventures is investing in a synthetic fuel venture in our efforts to diversify methods for the decarbonization of fuel.

## Supply chain emissions

## Scope 3 and emissions reduction initiatives

Kajima Group Scope 3 (supply chain upstream and downstream) emissions (Categories 1 and 11) in FY2024 were 1,183 x10 4 t-CO2. CO2 emissions from building operations (Category 11) decreased from the base year, partly due to the expanded use of ZEB in design-build projects. CO2 emissions from building material manufacture (Category 1) have not decreased significantly, but we will continue using low-carbon concrete and steel frameworks where feasible.

* The figures for FY2023 and FY2024 have been adjusted upward to reflect the impact of a weaker yen and higher material costs.

## · Reducing CO2 from building operation (Category 11)

Consumption of electricity, gas and other forms of energy continues for 30 to 60 years after building operation begins. As such, reducing CO2 during this phase with energy conservation is crucial in terms of whole life carbon. Under the Building Energy Conservation Act, Kajima sets targets for primary energy consumption for all buildings that it designs and constructs nationwide. We aim for a 40% reduction by FY2026, the final year of the current Medium-Term Business Plan, and a 50% reduction by FY2030. We have achieved a 41.9% reduction in buildings constructed in FY2024, thereby achieving the FY2026 target ahead of schedule.

## · Reducing CO2 from building material manufacture (Category 1)

We use concrete, cement and steel (steel framework) in very large quantities, so it is easy to target them for initiatives. We are working to reduce CO2 from their manufacture. In FY2024, our usage rate of low-carbon concrete and cement was about 12%, and our usage rate of steel framework produced by electric furnaces was about 36%.

## · Estimating the lifecycle carbon for buildings at an early stage

Japan's Inter-Ministerial Liaison Meeting on Building Lifecycle Carbon Reduction expects a system around FY2028 to promote building lifecycle assessments. In anticipation, Kajima developed Carbon Foot Scope—an AI-based system that accurately estimates CO2 emissions across a building's lifecycle. At a meeting of the Architectural Institute of Japan, we described trends in CO2 emissions using this system to analyze 15 properties upon the request of owners, as well as 65 properties that we built.

## Reducing CO2 by 35% in construction, repair and demolition work on a mediumsized office building

Nagoya Fushimi K Frontier is a medium-sized office building developed, designed, and constructed by Kajima. We repurposed existing underground earth retaining structures, used framework produced by electric furnaces, and employed other techniques to reduce lifecycle carbon (excluding energy consumption from operation) by 35% at the contract documentation phase compared to the design development phase.

Major measures include using proprietary low-carbon concrete, fueling construction vehicles with a diesel alternative, selecting low-carbon resin for the raised floor that is often renewed or repaired, and creating optimal renewal and reformation plans based on the long-term facility repair plan.

Targets and results for businesses by Kajima (non-consolidated) and its domestic group companies

In Kajima Environmental Vision 2050plus, we set circular economy KPIs regarding recycled material usage rate and construction waste recycling rate. This is because we feel we must not only reduce the final disposal volume in the core of circular economy activities, but also use recycled materials and reduce resource use if we seek to shift to a circular economy in our material-heavy construction business.

Our KPIs for estimated recycled material usage in main materials are 40% by FY2026 and 60% by FY2030. We have also set use rate targets for low-carbon concrete and steel framework produced by electric furnaces—two categories that are easy to suggest to customers and that we commonly use. Low-carbon concrete replaces part of high-carbon cement with slag and other industrial byproducts, while electric furnace steel repurposes scrap steel. Both are thus classified as recycled materials. We also aim to expand timber and wood-based buildings, as wood is a renewable natural material. These efforts contribute to both carbon neutrality (reducing and absorbing CO2) and nature positivity (reducing extraction impacts and increasing natural capital), creating synergy across carbon neutrality, circular economy, and

## Circular economy and carbon neutrality synergy with low carbon materials in the Naruse Dam

Dam construction requires a large amount of concrete. For the Naruse Dam, the largest trapezoidal CSG dam *1 in Japan (to be completed in FY2027 in Higashinaruse Village of Akita Prefecture), Kajima has used materials that can contribute to both a circular economy and carbon neutrality.

Fly ash from coal-fired power plants is often disposed of as industrial waste without effective reuse. Kajima and three other organizations *2 developed fly ash CSG using 435 t of non-JIS-standard fly ash in this project. Compared to conventional CSG, CO2 emissions from manufacturing are 28% lower.

We also used a total of 1,526 m 3 of ECM concrete*3 in parts of the dam embankment and foundations as a low-carbon concrete product. As a result, we reduced CO2 emissions from dam construction by 73 t-CO2. This marks Japan's first large-scale use of ECM concrete in a dam embankment.

nature positivity initiatives. The recycled material usage rate in FY2024 was 34%.

The recycling rate is the percentage of recycled construction waste, with ongoing initiatives focused on reducing and sorting waste. We recycle construction waste as much as possible or appropriately dispose of it in accordance with law. Even waste contaminated with dirt or adhesives— normally unsuitable for recycling—is being processed in collaboration with manufacturers across multiple product categories. Plastic waste, in particular, still has significant potential for improvement. In response to the 2022 Plastic Resource Circulation Act, we are developing technologies to recycle plastic collected from construction sites.

## Circular economy with wood-based material: Rebuilding the Tohoku Branch building

Kajima and its Group company, Katabami, signed an agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in December 2024 to promote the use of timber in buildings. We aim to create a circular system that fully utilizes forest resources, contributing to a sustainable society where environmental conservation and economic activity coexist.

As part of this initiative, the Tohoku Branch will be rebuilt as a flagship wooden building using fire-resistant laminated timber made entirely of wood. The building will feature our newly developed Transom Seismic Damping System (patent pending), inspired by traditional Japanese architecture, providing earthquake resistance comparable to that of high-rise buildings. The working space adopts a multi-pillar design, with all pillars and beams made of wood, creating a comfortable environment that supports both physical and mental well-being. Approximately 1,810 m³ of timber will be used for structural elements, partly sourced from Kajima Group-owned forests in Tohoku, with the remainder procured in collaboration with forestry stakeholders and timber producers.

## Horizontal recycling for carpet tiles

Office renovations generate large volumes of waste carpet tiles. In the absence of systems for separate collection or direct delivery to recycling plants, these tiles are typically sent as mixed waste to intermediate treatment facilities and landfilled. Tiles consist of textile and resin layers, making them difficult to separate and recycle.

Kajima collaborated with a client *3 that actively uses recycled products in the renovation of buildings it owns and manages, to achieve the horizontal recycling of carpet tiles.

The waste tiles are collected*4 separately in dedicated vehicles so that they are not mixed with other waste, and are taken directly to a plant *4 that makes recycled PVC—a material used in the tiles. In this way, we use waste tiles to manufacture*5 recycled ones.

## Material recycle

Construction sites generate various waste plastics, but contamination and mixing often lead even clean packaging material to be incinerated, hindering recycling in the construction sector. Kajima collects waste plastics from construction sites and recycles them into products that are usable on-site, such as safety supplies.

## Manufacturing of recycled barricades

Waste plastics generated at construction sites, including those of Kajima, are collected *1 and sorted and preprocess at intermediate treatment facilities*1. They are then cleaned, crushed, and converted into recycled resin at a plastic molding company *2 , where the recycled resin is mixed with polypropylene resin to manufacture recycled barricades.

These barricades are used at Kajima's construction sites, enabling on-site recycling of waste plastics into new products. Kajima has achieved resource circulation within construction sites.

## · Revising the Kajima Group Biodiversity Policy

Kajima significantly revised the Kajima Group Biodiversity Policy in April 2025. We changed the phrase "harmoniously co-existing with nature" to "nature positivity" to align with Kajima Environmental Vision 2050plus, and pledged to actively contribute to nature positivity through our business activities, including the supply chain.

https://www.kajima.co.jp/english/sustainability/policy/environment/index.html

## · TNFD-based information disclosure and future initiatives

In August 2023, Kajima joined the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum. Ahead of this, we identified and assessed nature-related risks and opportunities in a pilot project based on the TNFD Beta Framework (v0.4) and published the results. We are now applying the Recommendations of the TNFD (v1.0) and plan to disclose our updated analysis within this fiscal year.

## Gaining environmental certification for Kajima's wellness retreat

The KX-FOREST KARUIZAWA wellness retreat in Izuminosato, Karuizawa gained Platinum status (the highest level) in SITES, an international environmental certification for landscapes. This is the first lodging facility in Japan to do so. It also gained Triple Star status (the highest rank) in the Certification System for Securing Quantity and Quality Urban Green Space (TSUNAG) created by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). We promote the use of group-owned forests and timber from our land.

We preserved and utilized the existing natural landscape as much as possible while creating a resort space.

## Associating with local communities

Kajima helped to create 31.0 t‐CO2 in blue carbon with technology to support eelgrass bed rehabilitation. Based on longtime activities by Ashikita High School, a regional partnership agreement was signed by six organizations*. We aim to create a model case for community-led nature positivity activities that generate positive cycles, with participation from stakeholders such as regional financial institutions. We have been selected for a basic construction support project under the FY2025 Strategic Reiwa Sea Management Initiative by the Ministry of the Environment.

Quality assurance initiatives

Kajima maintains ISO 9001 certification in both its Civil

Engineering and Building Construction divisions by continuing to operate comprehensive quality management systems. The

Civil Engineering Division operates a quality control system based on ISO standards, as defined in the Civil Engineering

Work Manual, Civil Engineering Work Management

Procedure, and Construction Plan Creation Procedure.

Construction plans are designed to clearly identify potential issues and implement preventive measures. Follow-up is

conducted through on-site management and periodic internal inspections, with process improvements made as necessary.

The Building Construction Division applies KTMS (Kenchiku

Koji Total Management System), a proprietary ISO-based quality management system. The KTMS Basic Operation

Procedure defines systematic management methods for each operational phase, including planning, design, construction,

and maintenance. Daily on-site quality management receives consistent oversight from both branch offices and the Head

Office, including meetings, audits, inspections, and site patrols. Knowledge-sharing through the corporate intranet

further enhances employees’ quality control capabilities.

## Outside Officer Discussion

Outside Director Tamotsu Saito, who chairs the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee, gathered with Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Members Masahiro Nakagawa and Emiko Takeishi. They discussed several topics, including board deliberations, talent development, and the principal challenges that must be addressed to sustain future growth.

Emiko Takeishi Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Member

Member of the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee

## Impressions of Kajima

Tamotsu Saito

Outside Director

Chairperson of the Nomination Advisory Committee

Chairperson of the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee deep sense of duty to support the nation's craftsmanship and infrastructure through its technical excellence.

Saito My initial impression of Kajima is its deeply human character. This might explain why many clients choose to place custom orders with Kajima, relying on a strong relationship built on mutual trust. I have also observed Kajima's formidable technical capabilities. Recently, I visited Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan and saw the Sustainability Dome, which was constructed using Kajima's eco-friendly concrete. During Board sessions, briefings on seismic isolation and damping technologies—applied to projects such as Rapidus's new plant—reaffirmed Kajima's capacity to address societal challenges, from climate change to natural disasters.

Nakagawa In a positive sense, Kajima exemplifies the strengths of Japanese-style management. While it is often dismissed as conservative or outdated, I hold a different view. Kajima emphasizes corporate longevity and aligns its values with the collective interests of stakeholders, employee welfare, and social contribution—preserving the enduring strengths of Japan's management traditions. This company demonstrates a

Takeishi I strongly associate Kajima with the Kasumigaseki Building, Japan's first high-rise. While examining internal documents, I saw that Kajima used a large computer to analyze earthquake resistance and implemented other cutting-edge technologies of the time for construction. Since becoming an Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Member, I have also come to appreciate Kajima's growing global footprint. Established in Singapore in 2023, the GEAR advances R&amp;D and open innovation, serving as a foothold for overseas growth. It's clear to me that Kajima places great importance on partnerships—with clients, partner companies, and beyond.

Nakagawa Over my seven years as an Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Member, I have observed several notable changes.

First, the Group's business has expanded—particularly in overseas and real estate development. While these areas offer encouraging growth, they also call for adapted decision-

making processes and more tailored risk controls.

Domestically, Kajima is tackling projects in socially significant fields: in civil engineering, the company has been an early mover in renewable energy—such as offshore wind in Akita—and in building construction it has entered growth domains requiring advanced engineering, including semiconductor and biomanufacturing facilities.

Kajima's approach to workstyles has also evolved. By responding to the challenging limit on overtime work that took effect in FY2024, we have achieved rapid work style reform. I believe a company-wide awareness of changing work methods—through automation and digitalization to reduce hours—has spread to all our worksites and gained traction with our clients.

## Supervising function of the Board of Directors

Takeishi Recently, the Board of Directors has been discussing medium- to long-term issues, including workstyle reform, sustainability, and innovation. This marks a significant shift. Company board meetings can sometimes be somewhat formulaic, but not at Kajima. The reports openly address concerns related to the current business landscape, and the discussions are balanced and lively. I find it very easy to speak up at Kajima's Board meetings.

Nakagawa As Kajima expands its business both domestically and overseas, the broad expertise of our outside officers is vital for effectively overseeing our two distinct business models: construction and real estate development.

While dialogue between outside officers and executives primarily takes place at Board meetings, we should create opportunities for open-ended discussions to leverage their diverse cross-sector expertise. This would allow us to freely explore broad topics and discover new themes.

Saito As GX and DX efforts accelerate, it will also be essential to discuss the future direction of the construction business. Although our three-year Medium-Term Business Plan focuses on the near term, we must also consider what lies beyond. Fundamental discussions are vital for creating comfortable office and living environments by utilizing all available approaches, including conventional construction and digital technologies.

While Kajima is performing well and making steady progress on its Medium-Term Business Plan, I believe it is vital for the Board to continue supporting this growth through active discussion, particularly in the area of effective risk management.

## Revision of the officer remuneration system and agenda of the Nomination Advisory Committee

Saito A key aspect of revising officer remuneration was raising the proportion of performance-linked remuneration, taking into account trends in other companies. There was a consensus to adopt ROE—a key KPI in our Medium-Term Business Plan—as a metric, while also including safety performance and employee engagement. Discussions concluded smoothly at the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee.

Takeishi Since officer remuneration was somewhat lower than that of other similarly sized companies, the outside officers proposed raising the overall compensation level. However, internal directors noted the need to maintain a fair balance with employee pay. Notably, an outside officer's opinion that increasing officer remuneration would improve employee motivation was ultimately accepted.

Saito Last year's discussions centered on the officer remuneration system, but this year I'd like to shift the focus toward governance.

Nakagawa The proposed revision to officer remuneration was recommended by the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee, which is composed solely of outside officers. These outside officers are the driving force behind corporate governance reform.

Takeishi When it comes to governance, it is vital to remember that issues often occur in overlooked areas when businesses, subsidiaries, and overseas locations expand. It is important to take action from a broad perspective of the entire Group.

## Outside Officer Discussion

Saito The succession plan is the most significant issue in the Nomination Advisory Committee, which I also chair. Looking ahead to the next era of leadership, I would like to discuss how we can accelerate the appointment of Executive Officers. Divisions are often hesitant to release talented young and mid-career employees to other departments. When I was president of IHI Corporation, I introduced a framework that allowed promising individuals to gain experience across multiple divisions. I've come to realize that without revisiting the underlying structure, it's difficult to identify and promote such talent—and I hope Kajima will consider this seriously.

Takeishi On the topic of talent development, I see another important challenge. Kajima is actively promoting women in the workplace, but progress is still underway, and I remain concerned about the low number of female executives. I hope diversity will be more intentionally incorporated into the succession planning process. While full-time, front-line employees tend to stand out, I believe there are also highly capable and motivated individuals whose work pace may be temporarily adjusted due to childcare or other responsibilities. I'd like to see Kajima identify and support these employees, enabling women thrive over the long term.

## Kajima’s people, technology, and core strengths

Saito Last year, a Kajima representative spoke at a seminar attended by companies from various industries, where I learned that Kajima is increasingly using AI in its design work. I feel that Kajima is very passionate about its efforts, even when compared with other manufacturers. Kajima is accelerating R&amp;D due to the increased demand for AI

utilization in design and construction, which is driven by labor shortage concerns. This is one of Kajima's strengths.

Nakagawa As a technology-based company, Kajima advances R&amp;D through its Technical Research Institute in Japan and The GEAR in Singapore, while also recognizing that construction sites themselves are places of constant, incremental innovation. Innovation and creative disruption are often attributed to exceptional entrepreneurs; yet, they more often emerge within large enterprises where talent, technology, and capital converge to create powerful synergies. Even when promising solutions are proposed by external startups, embedding them effectively in day-to-day site operations is rarely straightforward. By contrast, in-house technological ideas can be swiftly piloted and scaled across sites, providing a more direct pathway to innovation.

Takeishi I agree that Kajima possesses extensive technology and expertise at its sites. Unlike mass manufacturing, construction is unique in that every project and every site presents new conditions. We must advance the work while tackling daily challenges—for example, devising countermeasures against spring water during excavation. I was genuinely impressed by the sheer breadth of this accumulated technical capability.

When I visited the track switching operation at JR Shibuya Station, I learned that around 1,000 workers were involved in each switch. I was impressed with Kajima's ability to coordinate everyone in the same direction. Systematically codifying and building upon this on-site knowhow could support ongoing business growth.

Nakagawa Going back to the topic of labor shortages, the construction industry went through a difficult period marked by compliance issues and weak performance, which hurt its overall reputation. While construction work can be tough, it supports people's lives and lays the foundations for national and social development. This is why young people continue to aspire to the profession. I believe the key is to help them envision a career in construction that offers a promising future, diverse career paths, personal fulfillment, and commensurate compensation. Accordingly, one of Kajima's most important tasks is to consistently communicate its vision and values to society.

Takeishi I agree. Employee feedback during the development of the Medium-Term Business Plan indicates that young employees prioritize social contribution. Kajima should take a more proactive approach to highlight the benefits of construction. Labor shortages are a widespread problem across the industry, and Kajima should take a leadership role in addressing this issue. Kajima is already leading efforts to

improve the careers of skilled workers at partner companies and has established and manages the Kajima Partner College. I hope that Kajima continues to prioritize talent development with an industry-wide perspective.

## Longer-term issues and expectations for Kajima

Nakagawa As I noted earlier, a key challenge lies in effectively steering both the construction and real estate development businesses, each with its own distinct risk profile. Despite the upheavals of recent years—including the pandemic and inflation—our overseas operations have expanded substantially, contributing significantly to our earnings. Since the business landscape and local characteristics vary between regions, it is important to deal with uncertainty. Kajima must also strengthen its ability to respond to unforeseen events, sharpen its risk detection capabilities, and ensure swift information flows.

Saito Looking ahead, I believe Kajima's long-term success will increasingly be driven by its overseas projects. Although robust domestic projects may sustain earnings in the near term, they alone cannot achieve the scale of growth required. For example, the global demand for data centers and the power facilities that support them is expected to surge. I therefore encourage Kajima to continue expanding internationally. From my experience at IHI, which has undertaken large-scale overseas projects such as bridges, I have learned that smooth execution requires a deep understanding of local legal frameworks, tax regimes,

<!-- image -->

and various other factors. By assigning more employees to overseas roles, Kajima can strengthen its organizational resilience and execution capability.

Takeishi Even with today's robust performance, Kajima should avoid settling into routine and continue to take on bold new challenges rather than relying on precedent. Paradoxically, the lack of an external crisis to spur transformation feels like a potential risk in itself.

Skilled talent is the most valuable assets in construction, as people work together to continuously address issues at sites. By stepping up diversity efforts and tapping into the unique strengths of its people, Kajima can build a workplace where everyone thrives and drives sustainable growth.

## Corporate Governance

## Overview of the corporate governance structure

Kajima has elected to use a Company with an Audit &amp; Supervisory Board structure, in which the Board of Directors makes key business decisions and monitors business execution and its Audit &amp; Supervisory Board audits the execution of duties by directors.

We have established a structure where Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Members, including independent outside members, conduct rigorous audits. The Board of Directors, composed of directors well versed in Kajima's businesses and outside directors with extensive management experience and deep insight gained as corporate executives, deliberates and decides on key management policies and oversees the execution of operations.

To strengthen business oversight, Kajima has established two advisory committees to the Board of Directors: the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee. To enhance operational

## Corporate governance structure

efficiency, we have established the Management Committee and the Joint Committee of Directors and Executive Officers. The Management Committee, chaired by the President, meets weekly to discuss and decide on critical operational matters as directed by the Board of Directors.

The Basic Policy for Building Internal Control Systems is established by Board of Directors resolution. This policy aims to ensure strict compliance, efficient business execution, and effective risk management, while guaranteeing reliable financial reporting, underpinned by the organizational structure described above. The Internal Control Committee regularly reviews the establishment and operation of the internal control system and reports its findings to the Board of Directors.

In addition, operating independently from business execution, the Audit Department audits Kajima Corporation and its Group companies in accounting, business activities, internal controls, and compliance and risk management. Audit findings are reported directly to the Board of Directors and the Audit &amp; Supervisory Board.

## Expertise and experience desired of directors and Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Members

Since Kajima broadly operates businesses across all phases of the value chain, mainly in domestic and overseas construction and real estate development, its directors and Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Members must possess experience, expertise, and exceptional qualities to ensure appropriate decisionmaking and effective supervision of management. From that perspective, we have created a skills matrix to identify the necessary qualifications for directors, including expertise in business, finance, and technology. Director selection considers broad diversity and composition, aiming for a balanced mix of knowledge, experience, and capabilities. To ensure objectivity and transparency in the nomination of candidates for director and Audit &amp; Supervisory Board Member roles, discussions and decisions are guided by the recommendations and insights provided by the Nomination Advisory Committee.

## Evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors

Kajima evaluates the effectiveness of its Board of Directors once a year in order to enhance the Board's functions. The method for analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the results for the period from June 2024 to May 2025 are described below.

## Analysis and evaluation method

- (1) Retain an external organization to conduct a survey of all directors and members of the Audit &amp; Supervisory Board.
- (2) Based on the results of the survey and quantitative and qualitative analysis of matters such as the content of agenda items submitted to the Board of Directors meetings and the deliberation time, all members of the Board of Directors discuss actions taken in response to the recommendations and issues raised in the evaluation conducted in past fiscal years. They also review the activities of the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee, as well as future issues and other topics, to evaluate their effectiveness.
- (3) The evaluation process and results are reviewed by external experts to ensure objectivity.

## Evaluation results for the current period

The Board of Directors evaluated that the Board, the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee are functioning appropriately and their effectiveness is being ensured.

- Based on the results of quantitative and qualitative analyses and surveys conducted by external organizations, the composition, operations, and deliberations of the Board of Directors are considered appropriate.
- Sufficient discussions have been held regarding the progress of initiatives under the Medium-Term Business Plan, including the current status of each business division and sustainability-related efforts.
- We continue to facilitate more in-depth Board discussions, expand opportunities for dialogue outside of meetings, and regularly review the Board's composition.

## 3. Nomination Advisory Committee and Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee

When the Board of Directors deliberated on officer appointments and remuneration, the outside director who chaired both committees presented the outcomes and recommendations from the discussions. The Board then reviewed these inputs and made decisions accordingly. This framework is recognized as ensuring the Board's objectivity, transparency, and effectiveness.

## Future issues

- (1) Address agenda items such as digitalization and domestic branch reports. Continue to use written resolutions and simplify agenda explanations
- (2) Consider holding site visits
- (3) Continue discussions to diversify the composition of the Board of Directors

## Officer remuneration

## · Director remuneration

## Basic policy

- Remuneration standards are set to secure and retain outstanding management personnel.
- Remuneration is structured in accordance with the roles and responsibilities of each position.
- Remuneration linked to the achievement of management targets and to Kajima's stock price are to be introduced to increase mediumto long-term corporate value and to align officer values with those of stockholders.
- The remuneration decision-making processes must be objective and transparent.

To ensure objectivity and transparency in determining director remuneration, the Governance and Remuneration Advisory Committee, which is comprised of outside directors and outside members of the Audit &amp; Supervisory Board and chaired by an outside director, discusses matters including the basic policy on officer remuneration, remuneration systems, and remuneration standards. The Board of Directors deliberates and decides on such matters based on the advice and recommendations of the Committee.

Kajima provides fixed remuneration to directors in the form of monthly remuneration, performance-linked remuneration in the form of bonuses, and stock remuneration, determined by position (including the executive officer position for directors concurrently serving in that role).

Furthermore, at the March 2025 Board of Directors meeting, revisions were made to the director remuneration system.

## Risk Management

## Group-wide risk management system

Based on effective and efficient risk management systems, the Kajima Group strives to identify risks in its businesses and operations and to prevent them from materializing. The Group also works to keep improving corporate value by winning the trust of stockholders, customers, and others with timely information disclosure.

The Compliance and Risk Management Committee (chaired by the President) oversees the overall risk management framework. For business risks, such as those associated with new businesses and development investments, the committee draws on deliberations by the Management Committee and special-purpose committees to identify risks and formulate countermeasures. For operational risks, including potential legal or regulatory violations, the committee designates a responsible department for each risk, monitors and evaluates the operational status of the risk management system, and deliberates on risk management policies and responses to significant risk events. In addition, the Internal Control Committee (chaired by the President) reviews the operational status and effectiveness of the risk management system and reports its findings to the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Liaison Committee, composed of individuals in charge at the Head Office department responsible for risk management, meets regularly (24 times in FY2024) to report and share risks that have materialized in the Group, revisions to laws and regulations, social trends, case studies at other companies, and risk communication methodologies. It also reports important information to the Compliance and Risk Management Committee as appropriate.

## Risk management activities

To enhance the effectiveness of risk management activities, Kajima analyzes various risks anticipated in corporate operations at the beginning of each fiscal year from two perspectives: frequency of occurrence and level of impact. Based on this analysis, operational risks requiring prioritized management are identified and designated as "priority risk management issues." Preventive risk management activities are then promoted accordingly. For risks that have materialized, prompt reporting is mandatory. Such cases are reported and shared at the Risk Management Liaison Committee, which implements organizational measures to prevent escalation and recurrence. During and at the end of each fiscal year, these activities are reviewed and evaluated, and the findings are incorporated into the following year's initiatives, ensuring that risk management remains effective and aligned with the PDCA cycle. The General Administration Department, serving as the secretariat of the Compliance and Risk Management Committee, continuously monitors the status and progress of responses to materialized risks and submits regular reports to the Committee. The main domestic and overseas Group companies adopt standardized systems in line with those of Kajima, and they independently introduce risk management initiatives.

## Information Security

## · Information security management framework and activities

The Kajima Group has established an Information Security Policy to protect buildings, customers, and various types of management, technical, and intellectual property information from external attacks and leaks caused by human error, and strictly enforces risk management.

As the team responsible for promoting Company-wide information security activities under the leadership of the Chief Information Security Officer, who oversees all management of information security, K-SIRT *1 takes the lead on working with each of the branches, departments, and domestic and overseas Group companies to reduce risks.

As a prevention measure, employees throughout the Group take an annual online course on information security. This makes everyone aware of incidents and the risks when using generative AI and other IT technologies. The Group also provides repeated education and training on risks such as targeted email attacks. At its offices, Kajima conducts regular inspections and audits to evaluate and improve physical, personal and technical measures. For partner companies, Kajima also distributes standard check sheets, awareness posters, and educational materials such as a video provided by the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors (JFCC), to improve the level of information security, including throughout the supply chain.

*1 KAJIMA Security Incident Response Team

## FY2024 education and training record

- Training on targeted email attacks Conducted for 31,285 persons
- Online course on information security (Participation rate: 100%) Participants: 25,707 employees (including 9,826 employees from Group companies)

## · Cybersecurity

Kajima is addressing today's increasingly diverse and sophisticated cybersecurity threats in accordance with the Cybersecurity

## Information security management framework

<!-- image -->

Management Guidelines from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. K-SIRT is a member of the Nippon CSIRT Association and stays on top of the latest trends in security and cyber-attacks, cooperating on a regular basis with external organizations and CSIRT teams at other companies. Kajima is also strengthening its protection and detection measures as well as its systems for monitoring unauthorized access, computer viruses, and other events around the clock, 365 days a year, and it quickly addresses all potential threats to minimize potential damage.

Response guidelines have been formulated on rapidly launching a response to an incident and minimizing the damage and impact as much as possible. Every year, Kajima conducts a training drill based on a scenario of damage from a cybersecurity attack in an effort to improve systematic response capabilities and our ability to maintain business continuity.

## Multi-hazard business continuity plan

## · Strengthening the Kajima business continuity system

In the event of a natural disaster, Kajima has formulated a business continuity plan (BCP) to ensure "the safety of officers, employees, and their families" and "the continuation and early restoration of business activities." We regularly conduct training and pursue continuous improvements. Our strong business continuity capability has been recognized through certifications such as the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certification for Construction Companies *2 and the Resilience Certification*3. We also strive to enhance the business continuity capabilities of the entire supply chain by preparing and distributing BCP manuals for partner companies.

## · Building a disaster recovery support system based on disaster preparedness agreements *4

In the construction industry, companies play an essential role in the early restoration of social infrastructure following natural disasters, such as road clearance operations. Kajima has entered into disaster preparedness agreements with the JFCC, which receives requests from the national government, as well as with local governments and public infrastructure operators. Based on these agreements, we have established recovery support systems.

- *2 A program offered by the Kanto Regional Development Bureau under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to evaluate and certify the basic business continuity.
- *3 With the aim of enhancing disaster preparedness in Japan, this program provides certification to entities that are actively engaged in business continuity efforts. They are certified as organizations that contribute to national resilience through their preparations for large-scale natural disasters.
- *4 Agreements concluded concerning disaster recovery operations and the procurement of construction materials in the event of a disaster.

## Compliance

## Compliance program and implementation

The Kajima Group recognizes that compliance is the foundation of all our business activities. To articulate this stance, we have established the Kajima Group Code of Conduct as a common standard for directors, officers, and employees, under which we are committed to promoting compliance.

The Compliance and Risk Management Committee (chaired by the President) routinely accepts reports on the progress of compliance activities across the Group and, in the event of critical incidents arise, promptly issues instructions and corrective actions to address the incident and reports the details of the incident to the Board of Directors.

The Legal Department, which is part of the Administration Division, is in charge of compliance and has formulated and regularly reviews a compliance manual and conducts training through online courses. In addition, each department responsible for each business field set rules and guidelines and conduct training as necessary. The Audit Department, which independent of operational divisions, conducts internal audits as part of its business audits.

Each Group company has also established and implements a compliance program in line with that of Kajima.

## Major initiatives in FY2024

- Revision of compliance manual (10th edition)
- Online course on compliance (Participation rate: 100%) Participants: 25,710 employees (including 10,113 employees from 47 Group companies)

## Anti-corruption initiatives

Kajima has signed the United Nations Global Compact and supports the principle that "Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms." We have also established the Kajima Group Anti-Bribery Principles to further clarify our stance on anti-corruption initiatives.

## · Maintaining appropriate relationships with public officials in Japan

With respect to payments made to public officials in Japan and similar cases, we ensure strict adherence to the National Public Service Ethics Code and conduct rigorous checks on the legality and appropriateness of such payments.

## · Maintaining appropriate relationships with public officials overseas

We have also established policies and guidelines that specifically address relationships with public officials overseas. Group companies in Japan and overseas are also working to establish corresponding policies and guidelines, thereby promoting activities to prevent bribery risks.

In FY2024, we visited overseas subsidiaries and affiliates—particularly in Asia, where corruption risks are considered relatively high—to monitor the status of implementation. We will continue to strengthen and review our anti-bribery framework to ensure greater effectiveness.

## Initiatives for fair transactions with partner companies

Kajima recognizes partner companies, such as subcontractors and suppliers, as important business partners and strives to ensure fairness in transactions.

## · Maintaining proper relationships

Under the Kajima Group Code of Conduct, we maintain fair and equitable relationships with partner companies and have established strict company-wide rules that prohibit any coercive practices and, in principle, the acceptance of entertainment, hospitality, or gifts from partner companies. We also conduct strict due diligence prior to commencing business with each partner company to ensure fairness and transparency in the selection process.

In May 2025, we revised the form of basic construction subcontracting agreement to include a clause requiring business partners to comply with the Kajima Group Conduct Guidelines for Business Partners and encouraging them to do so accordingly. Going forward, we will continue to foster compliance throughout the entire supply chain.

## · Ensuring fairness in transactions and negotiation processes

We are also working to ensure fairness in our transactions with partner companies and in the related negotiation processes.

In April 2025, we revised the Kajima Declaration of Partnership Building to reflect the appropriate pass-through of rising labor and material costs. The aforementioned revision of the basic construction subcontracting agreements also incorporates amendments to the Construction Business Act.

## Ensuring strict compliance with the Anti-Monopoly Act

Kajima has established an Antitrust Law Committee under the Compliance and Risk Management Committee. The Legal Department, which serves as the Head Office secretariat, and the administration departments of each branch office, which serve as the branch office secretariats, play central roles in the ongoing initiatives to enforce a bid-rigging prevention framework.

Group companies that are engaged in activities to receive orders related to public procurement have also established and are abiding by regulations in accordance with the Kajima Regulations for Preventing Collusion, and we are actively involved in confirming the implementation status of each company by assisting them in their anti-bid-rigging audits and checking their audit reports.

## Current status of trial proceedings (as of August 2025)

In March 2023, the Tokyo High Court rejected our appeal against the guilty judgment rendered by the Tokyo District Court (the first court) in the criminal case for involving violations of the Anti-Monopoly Act in connection with the construction project of the Chuo Shinkansen. We appealed this judgment to the Supreme Court. In relation to the same incident, we filed an appeal against the Tokyo District Court's judgment that dismissed our claim to revoke the cease-and-desist order issued by the Japan Fair Trade Commission in December 2020. However, in May 2025, the Tokyo High Court rendered a judgment dismissing our appeal. We have since filed both an appeal and a petition for acceptance of final appeal to the Supreme Court against this judgment.

## Whistleblower system

We have established a whistleblower system (a corporate ethics hotline) through which employees of Kajima, Group companies, partner companies and others are able to report, anonymously if they prefer, facts or suspicions concerning wrongdoings or legal violations, including corruption such as bribery involving our officers or employees. In order to ensure the ease-of-use and effectiveness of this system, we have also established multiple contact points outside the Company. As a new initiative, we are also pursuing the introduction of a global whistleblower hotline that employees at overseas locations can report directly to the Head Office.

We provide online courses and distribute information leaflets throughout the Group to raise awareness of this system, foster an environment where employees can safely use this system for appropriate whistleblowing, and improve the effectiveness of the system.

## Whistleblowing reports to the corporate ethics hotline in FY2024

- 136 (Response results: 17 investigations, 119 consultations)

## Community support

## Participating in the Matsudai Tanada Bank initiative

As an official supporter of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries' Tsunagu Tanada Heritage initiative, Kajima is working to create a sustainable farming environment in terraced rice paddy regions and promote their appeal through its business and social contribution activities.

In FY2024, as a corporate owner of the Matsudai Tanada Bank (Tokamachi City, Niigata Prefecture), which rents and cultivates rice paddies left untended, we had employees participate in rice planting and harvesting events, held events in our company cafeteria using the harvested rice, and shared information about these activities both internally and externally. In addition, in the terraced paddies of Tokamachi, we are

## IR Activities

We have established a Policy for Constructive Dialogue with Stockholders and strive to proactively disclose information and promote constructive dialog on business performance, medium- to long-term management policy, ESG, and other topics through financial results briefings, individual interviews, and other opportunities.

The opinions of stockholders and investors obtained through dialogue are reported regularly, in a timely manner, and appropriately to the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, and are reflected in improvements in management and investor relations (IR) activities.

In FY2024, we held dialogues regarding our growth strategies based on the Medium-Term Business Plan (FY2024–2026). We also worked to increase opportunities for dialogue with overseas institutional investors, held briefings for individual investors, and enhanced our disclosure materials.

## Summary and Forecast of Business Performance

Amounts less than ¥0.1 billion have been rounded down.

As for profit figures, operating income increased 11.5% year on year to ¥151.8 billion (compared with ¥136.2 billion in the previous fiscal year) and net income attributable to owners of the parent increased 9.4% to ¥125.8 billion (compared with ¥115.0 billion in the previous fiscal year) due to higher gross profits in the construction business and the real estate development and other businesses.

Our performance by business was as follows.

In the Company's construction business, revenues exceeded forecasts in both the civil engineering and building construction businesses due to steady construction progress, especially on large-scale projects. Gross profit margins in both the civil engineering (15.4%) and the building construction (9.6%) businesses were higher than in the previous fiscal year (13.7% and 9.2%, respectively). In the civil engineering business, improvement was seen each quarter up to the end of the fiscal year, and the building construction business showed improvement particularly from the third quarter onward. We believe we were able to accurately respond to rising construction costs while steadily growing profits. In the real estate development and other businesses, the delivery of condominiums and sales of office buildings in the fourth quarter progressed as planned, resulting in revenues and profits significantly exceeding those of the previous fiscal year.

Domestic subsidiaries and affiliates overall delivered lower revenues and profits compared to the previous fiscal year, when there were high sales of real estate for sale held by real estate development related subsidiaries and affiliates, but they maintained stable performance, primarily driven by the construction business, and contributed to consolidated financial results.

In the construction business at overseas subsidiaries and affiliates, both revenues and gross profit exceeded those of the previous fiscal year due to contributions from the U.S. construction company acquired in the first quarter and the

## Overview of Business Performance

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, the global economy progressed in a generally stable manner despite regional differences, as inflation subsided and policy interest rate cuts gradually spread. Although Japan's economy continued to experience a phase of rising prices and interest rates, improvements in the employment and income environment, along with inbound tourism demand, supported the ongoing moderate recovery.

In the domestic construction market, public-sector investment remained firm and corporate capital investment continued to increase. In construction costs, material and equipment prices remained high overall, and labor costs also rose in some regions and occupations due to high construction activity.

Against this backdrop, under the Kajima Group MediumTerm Business Plan (FY2024–2026), the Group has focused its efforts on construction and real estate development businesses in both Japan and overseas.

As a result, the Group's financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, were as follows.

Consolidated construction contract awards, both in Japan and overseas, fell below the high recorded in the previous fiscal year, coming in at ¥2,624.5 billion, down 10.3% year-on-year (compared with ¥2,927.2 billion in the previous fiscal year). Non-consolidated contract awards, including those for the real estate development and other businesses, declined 5.8% year on year to ¥1,831.1 billion (compared with ¥1,944.0 billion in the previous fiscal year).

Revenues rose 9.3% year on year to ¥2,911.8 billion (compared with ¥2,665.1 billion in the previous fiscal year), mainly due to increased revenues from overseas subsidiaries and affiliates.

## Analysis of Financial Position

## Assets, Liabilities and Equity

Total assets at the end of the fiscal year increased ¥319.4 billion year on year to ¥3,454.5 billion (compared with ¥3,135.1 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year). The increase was accounted for by an increase in notes and accounts receivable - trade, an increase in inventories, and an increase in property and equipment. The balance of strategic shareholdings at the end of the fiscal year was ¥253.5 billion (compared with ¥316.1 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year), with the ratio to total equity at 19.8% (compared with 25.8% at the end of the previous fiscal year), partly due to the sale of 34 stocks for ¥20.3 billion during the fiscal year.

Total liabilities increased ¥265.1 billion year on year to ¥2,176.6 billion (compared with ¥1,911.4 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year). This was mainly due to an increase in interest-bearing debt, an increase in notes and accounts payable - trade, and an increase in advances received on construction projects in progress.

Total equity increased by ¥54.3 billion year on year to ¥1,277.9 billion (compared with ¥1,223.6 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year).

In addition, the owners' equity ratio dropped to 36.4%, down 2.2 points compared with 38.6% at the end of the previous fiscal year.

## Cash Flows

Cash flows from operating activities in the fiscal year resulted in a net cash inflow of ¥30.6 billion (compared with ¥123.7 billion in the previous fiscal year). Main factors were income before income taxes, adjustments for depreciation and amortization, and an increase in advances received, offset by a decrease due to increase/decrease in consumption taxes payable/ consumption taxes refund receivable, income taxes-paid, an increase in receivables, and an increase in inventories.

Cash flows from investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of ¥104.8 billion (compared with ¥62.9 billion in the previous fiscal year). Main factors were payments for purchases of property and equipment, disbursements for loans, and payment for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, partially offset by inflows of proceeds from sales and redemption of marketable and investment securities, and proceeds from collection of loans.

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of ¥61.6 billion (compared with a net cash outflow of ¥9.5 billion in the previous fiscal year). This was mainly due to inflows of the net of financing and repayment of short-term borrowings, long-term loans, commercial paper and bonds, offset by cash dividends paid and payment for purchases of treasury stock.

As a result, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year decreased by ¥0.5 billion year on year to ¥349.5 billion (compared with ¥350.0 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year).

## Basic Profit Allocation Policy and Payment of Dividends*

The Company's basic policy is to allocate profits taking account of balance between growth investment and stockholder returns, with the aim of achieving sustainable growth and increasing corporate value, while maintaining financial soundness. Regarding dividends, the Company plans to pay dividends with a target payout ratio of 40%, as well as to flexibly contribute to stockholder returns by acquiring own shares and other means with consideration of business performance, financial condition and business environment.

In consideration of the aforementioned policy, and in light of the Company's business performance of the fiscal year under review, the Company paid an annual dividend of ¥104 per share, consisting of a year-end dividend of ¥59 per share and an interim (end of second quarter) dividend of ¥45 per share. The Company also plans to pay an annual dividend of ¥112 per share (including an interim dividend of ¥56 per share) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026.

## Forecast for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2026*

In the global economy, uncertainty regarding the economic outlook is increasing due to trade and monetary policies in various countries and regions, as well as geopolitical risks. Furthermore, societal demands and customer needs are expected to continue evolving, with human capital becoming increasingly important and environmental concerns necessitating a shift toward a circular economy. We believe that accurately identifying these various changes and challenges, and providing solutions based on solid technical capabilities and new value, is essential to achieving sustainable growth.

In the construction market, we anticipate solid construction demand to continue for the time being, both in Japan and overseas. In particular, investments related to measures to address aging infrastructure and to digitalization are expected to expand over the medium to long term. On the other hand, it will remain necessary to monitor rising construction costs, and it will be a significant challenge to establish a construction system with capacity to meet robust demand fully. Along with thorough cost management, we see an increasing need to strengthen construction capabilities, including those within the supply chain, by improving the remuneration and benefits of construction workers and enhancing productivity.

In the domestic construction business in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, we aim to maintain high revenues by establishing a solid construction system, including partner companies and skilled workers, while also accurately addressing rising construction costs and promoting productivity improvements to enhance gross profit margins. In the domestic real estate development business, the results of our investments to date are steadily materializing, and we plan to sell multiple properties. As for overseas businesses, although we need to carefully assess the economic impact of trade policies in various countries and regions, we will strive to improve profitability in both the construction and real-estate development businesses by thoroughly managing risk and strategically timing our business initiatives. Our exchange rate assumption is ¥145 to $1.

Reflecting the outlook for each business, we expect consolidated revenues and profits for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, to increase, for a fifth consecutive fiscal year of growth.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

KAJIMA Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries

Year Ended March 31, 2025

## 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kajima Corporation (the "Company") and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, the "Companies") have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan ("Japanese GAAP"), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan.

In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, to conform to the classifications used in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025.

The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorporated and mainly operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥150 to $1, the approximate rate of exchange at March 31, 2025. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

- a. Consolidation － The consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2025, include the accounts of the Company and its 181 (173 in 2024) significant subsidiaries.

Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.

Another 34 (33 in 2024) subsidiaries were not consolidated as they would not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

All unconsolidated subsidiaries and 107 (107 in 2024) affiliates were accounted for using the equity method.

(The Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates are collectively referred to as the “Group.”)

Goodwill, the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired subsidiary or affiliate at the date of acquisition, is amortized using the straight-line method over its useful life that goodwill is expected to have an effect.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from intercompany transactions is also eliminated.

As of March 31, 2025, the Company had 1 special purpose entity (1 in 2024) which was established and is being operated for the purpose of liquidation of real estate, and as such is not consolidated in accordance with Japanese GAAP. The total assets and liabilities of the special purpose entity were ¥26,847 million ($178,980 thousand) and ¥26,842 million ($178,947 thousand), respectively, as of March 31, 2025, and ¥25,276 million and ¥25,271 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2024. In addition, the Company recognized lease payments of ¥2,251 million ($15,007 thousand) and ¥2,270 million based on lease agreements of real estate for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The investment in silent partnership was ¥847 million ($5,647 thousand) and ¥847 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and its related distributed profit was ¥719 million ($4,793 thousand) and ¥918 million for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The breakdown and changes of fully consolidated companies and companies accounted for using the equity method are summarized below:

- (2) Changes for the year ended March 31, 2025
- b. Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries for the Consolidated Financial Statements － Japanese accounting standards prescribe that the accounting policies and procedures applied to a parent company and its subsidiaries for similar transactions and events under similar circumstances should in principle be unified for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. However, financial statements prepared by foreign subsidiaries in accordance with either IFRS Accounting Standards or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") tentatively may be used for the consolidation process, except for the following items that should be adjusted in the consolidation process so that net income is accounted for in accordance with Japanese GAAP, unless they are not material: (1) amortization of goodwill; (2) scheduled amortization of actuarial gain or loss of pensions that has been recorded in equity through other comprehensive income; (3) expensing capitalized costs of research and development; (4) cancellation of the fair value model of accounting for property, plant and equipment and investment properties and incorporation of the cost model of accounting; and (5) recording a gain or loss through profit or loss on the sale of an investment in an equity instrument for the difference between the acquisition cost and selling price, and recording impairment loss through profit or loss for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument, where a foreign subsidiary elects to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument.
- c. Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Affiliates for the Equity Method － Japanese accounting standards require adjustments to be made to conform the affiliate's accounting policies for similar transactions and events under similar circumstances to those of the parent company when the affiliate's financial statements are used in applying the equity method, unless it is impracticable to determine such adjustments. In addition, financial statements prepared by foreign affiliates in accordance with either IFRS Accounting Standards or U.S. GAAP tentatively may be used in applying the equity method if the following items are adjusted so that net income is accounted for in accordance with Japanese GAAP, unless they are not material: (1) amortization of goodwill; (2) scheduled amortization of actuarial gain or loss of pensions that has been recorded in equity through other comprehensive income; (3) expensing capitalized costs of research and development; (4) cancellation of the fair value model of accounting for property, plant and equipment and investment properties and incorporation of the cost model of accounting; and (5) recording a gain or loss through profit or loss on the sale of an investment in an equity instrument for the difference between the acquisition cost and selling price, and recording impairment loss through profit or loss for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument, where a foreign affiliate elects to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument.
- d. Business Combinations － Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Acquisition-related costs, such as advisory fees or professional fees, are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.
- e. Cash Equivalents － Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and exposed to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit, both of which mature or become due within three months of the date of acquisition.
- f. Inventories － Construction projects in progress are stated at cost as determined on a specific project basis. Related general and administrative expenses and financial charges are principally excluded from such costs.

| 1)  Newly consolidated companies                           | : 2 subsidiaries of Eaton Real Estate Co. Ltd., 3 subsidiaries of KUSA,  1 subsidiary of KE, 4 subsidiaries of KAP and 1 subsidiary of KA due to  establishment and acquisition   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2)  Companies excluded from consolidation                  | : 1 subsidiary of KE due to liquidation and 2 subsidiaries of KAP due to  transfer to affiliates resulting from sales of interests                                                |
| 3)  Companies newly accounted for using  the equity method | : 8 affiliates due to establishment, acquisition and transfer from  consolidated companies resulting from sales of interests                                                      |
| 4)  Companies excluded from the equity method              | : 7 affiliates due to sales of interests, liquidation and decrease of  influence                                                                                                  |

Japanese accounting standards require that inventories held for sale in the ordinary course of business be measured at the lower of cost or net selling value, which is defined as the selling price less additional estimated manufacturing costs and estimated direct selling expenses. The replacement cost may be used in place of the net selling value, if appropriate.

As a result, gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, decreased by ¥130 million ($867 thousand) and ¥13 million, respectively.

However, in the case of certain overseas subsidiaries, construction projects in progress, development projects in progress and real estate for sale are stated at cost, when not in excess of net realizable value.

- g. Capitalization of Interest － Interest costs incurred for real estate development projects conducted by certain overseas subsidiaries have been capitalized as part of the development costs of such projects. Interest expenses capitalized were ¥9,115 million ($60,767 thousand) and ¥8,263 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

- h. Marketable Securities, Operational Investments in Securities and Investments in Securities － Marketable securities, operational investments in securities and investments in securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management's intent, as follows:
- (1) Trading securities, which are held for the purpose of earning capital gains in the near term, are reported at fair value, and the related unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings;
- (2) Held-to-maturity debt securities, for which there is a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost; and
- (3) Available-for-sale securities, which are not classified as either of the aforementioned securities, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity.

The securities held by the Companies are mainly classified as available-for-sale securities. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the moving-average method. Nonmarketable available-for-sale equity securities are stated at cost determined by the moving-average method. For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, investment securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income.

- i. Property and Equipment － Property and equipment are principally stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and less gains deferred on the sale and replacement of certain assets. Depreciation has been principally computed using the decliningbalance method while the straight-line method is applied to buildings acquired on or after April 1, 1998, and building improvements and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016.

The estimated useful lives for buildings and structures range from 2 to 60 years, and for machinery, equipment and other, range from 2 to 20 years.

However, in the accounts of certain overseas subsidiaries, depreciation is principally calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

Accumulated depreciation totaled ¥404,251 million ($2,695,007 thousand) and ¥377,978 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Under certain conditions such as exchanges of fixed assets of similar kinds and sales and purchases resulting from expropriation, Japanese tax laws permit companies to defer the profit arising from such transactions by reducing the cost of the assets acquired or by providing a special reserve in the equity section.

The amount directly deducted from the acquisition cost of construction in progress due to the conversion of rights in connection with a Type 1 Urban Redevelopment Project under the Urban Redevelopment Law was ¥23,229 million for the year ended March 31, 2024.

- j. Long-Lived Assets － The Companies review their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
- k. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts － Allowance for doubtful accounts provided by the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is stated in amounts considered to be appropriate based on each company's past credit loss experience and an evaluation of potential losses in the receivables and others outstanding. However, the overseas consolidated subsidiaries provide for such possible losses using management's estimate.
- l. Retirement Benefits － The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries have funded and/or unfunded retirement benefit plans covering their employees. In addition, the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries have defined contribution plans.

The Company accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within equity (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects and are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 10 years no longer than the expected average remaining service period of the employees. The discount rate is determined using a single weighted-average discount rate reflecting the estimated timing and amount of benefit payment.

- m. Asset Retirement Obligation － An asset retirement obligation is recorded for a legal obligation imposed either by law or contract that results from the acquisition, construction, development and normal operation of a tangible fixed asset and is associated with the retirement of such tangible fixed asset. The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the discounted cash flows required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost.

- n. Significant Basis for Recording Revenues and Costs － The main performance obligations of the Companies in their primary businesses and the point in time when the Companies typically satisfy the performance obligations (when the Companies typically recognize revenues) are as follows:
- (1) Construction business

The Companies carry out civil engineering, building construction, equipment and other general construction work based on executed construction contracts, and have performance obligations to deliver products such as completed buildings to customers. When a control over the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer over time, revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation to transfer the goods or services to the customer is satisfied. The progress of the satisfaction is primarily measured based on the ratio of the cumulative construction costs incurred by the end of the financial year against the total estimated construction costs.

- (2) Real estate development and other

The Companies carry out real estate development, architectural, structural and other design and engineering services based on executed real estate sales and outsourcing contracts, and have performance obligations to provide services or deliver properties/deliverables to customers. When a control over the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer over time, revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation to transfer the goods or services to the customer is satisfied. In other cases, revenue is recognized at a point in time when such properties/deliverables are delivered because it is considered that the performance obligation is to be satisfied at a point in time and the revenue is recognized at the time when the properties/deliverables are delivered. In case of applying the method to recognize revenue over time, the progress of the satisfaction of the performance obligation is primarily measured based on the ratio of the cumulative costs incurred by the end of the financial year against the total estimated costs.

In the construction business and the real estate development and other businesses, the alternative treatment is applied when the duration of transaction, such as from the beginning of the transaction to the point when the performance obligation is expected to be fully satisfied, is distinctively short. In such cases, the revenue is recognized at the point when the performance obligations are fully satisfied rather than being recognized over time.

- o. Costs of Research and Development and Debenture Issuance － All research and development costs and debenture issuance costs are charged to income as incurred. Costs of research and development for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, totaled ¥22,207 million ($148,047 thousand) and ¥20,762 million, respectively.
- p. Leases － Finance lease transactions are capitalized by recognizing lease assets and lease obligations in the balance sheet. All other leases are mainly accounted for as operating leases.
- q. Bonuses to Directors － Bonuses to directors are accrued at the end of the year to which such bonuses are attributable.
- r. Income Taxes － The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences.

The Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries have applied the Group Tax Sharing System.

- s. Accounting Principles and Procedures Adopted where the Relevant Accounting Standards are not Specified － Joint ventures, which the Company and its certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries form with other companies for the purpose of winning and managing construction projects, are not accounted as separate entities, but the construction revenue and the construction costs arising in the joint ventures are proportioned to individual financial statements in accordance with the share in the joint venture.
- t. Foreign Currency Transactions － All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of income to the extent that they are not hedged by forward exchange contracts or currency swaps.
- u. Foreign Currency Financial Statements － The balance sheet accounts and revenue and expense accounts of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date except for equity, which is translated at the historical exchange rate.

Differences arising from such translation are shown as "Foreign currency translation adjustments" under accumulated other comprehensive income in a separate component of equity.

- v. Derivatives and Hedging Activities － The Companies use derivative financial instruments ("derivatives") to manage their exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. Foreign exchange forward contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps are principally utilized by the Companies to reduce the risks arising from the factors mentioned above. The Companies do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Derivatives are classified and accounted for as follows:

- (1) All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, and gains or losses on derivative transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of income; and
- (2) For derivatives used for hedging purposes, if such derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions.

The derivative instruments applied for forecasted or committed transactions are measured at fair value, but the unrealized gains and losses are deferred until the underlying transactions are completed.

The monetary debts and credits denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts or currency swaps are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the contracted rate if the forward contracts or currency

swaps qualify for hedge accounting.

Interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income.

- w. Gain on Step Acquisitions － For the year ended March 31, 2024, the Companies recognized a gain on step acquisition resulting from consolidating an affiliate of KE previously accounted for using the equity method by acquiring additional interests.
- x. Per Share Information － Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

Diluted net income per share is not disclosed because the Companies did not have dilutive shares for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective financial years including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.

- y. Change in Accounting Policy － The Company has applied "The Accounting for and Disclosure of Current Taxes Related to the Global Minimum Tax Rules" (Practical Solution No.46 issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan ("ASBJ") on March 22, 2024) from the beginning of the year ended March 31, 2025. The Company has recorded corporate taxes related to the global minimum tax rules based on a reasonable estimate, calculated from the difference between the base tax rate (15%) and the tax rates applicable in the countries where its subsidiaries are located. The application of the new accounting policy had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025.
- z. New Accounting Pronouncements － On September 13, 2024, the ASBJ issued ASBJ Statement No. 34, "Accounting Standard for Leases" and ASBJ Guidance No. 33, "Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Leases."
- (1) Overview

The accounting standards require lessees to record assets and liabilities for all leases, consistent with the International Accounting Standards.

- (2) Scheduled date of application

The accounting standards are scheduled to be applied from the beginning of the year ending March 31, 2028.

(2) Information on the significant accounting estimate

The construction revenue is calculated by multiplying the total estimated construction revenue by the progress principally based on cumulative construction costs incurred by the end of the financial year against the total estimated construction costs.

The estimation of the total construction revenue and the total construction costs is based on the operational budget which is compiled at the beginning of the construction and updated in a timely manner. At the same time, the progress of the contract is principally estimated by the ratio of the cumulative construction costs incurred by the end of the financial year against the total estimated construction costs.

As construction progresses, the aforementioned estimation is influenced by factors such as: 1) the variation orders regarding changes in construction methods or scope; 2) the fluctuations of the price in the construction materials and labor market; and 3) the changes of construction costs led by condition changes related to projects. Such factors could have material impact on the amount of construction revenue, construction costs and provision for loss on construction projects in progress in the consolidated financial statements for the following financial year.

The impairment losses on available-for-sale securities were ¥1,042 million ($6,947 thousand) and ¥252 million for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

## 6. REVALUATION OF LAND

Under the "Law of Land Revaluation," the Company and a domestic consolidated subsidiary adopted a one-time revaluation of their land in Japan to a value based on real estate appraisal information as of March 31, 2002.

The resulting land revaluation excess represents unrealized appreciation of land and is stated, net of income taxes, as a component of equity. Continuous readjustment is not permitted unless the land value subsequently declines significantly such that the amount of the decline in value should be removed from the land revaluation excess account and related deferred tax liabilities.

## 7. LONG-LIVED ASSETS

For the year ended March 31, 2025, the Companies recognized impairment losses of the following assets:

| Use             | Type of assets                                                                         | Location        |   Number of assets |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
|                 | Assets used for business Machinery, equipment and other Hiroshima Prefecture and other |                 |                  2 |
| Idle properties | Machinery, equipment and other Kanagawa Prefecture                                     | and others      |                  6 |
| Other           | Intangible asset                                                                       | Georgia, U.S.A. |                  1 |

For purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment, assets used for business are evaluated by branch office and idle properties are evaluated individually.

The carrying amounts of certain assets used for business were devalued to their recoverable amounts due to declining profitability. The carrying amounts of idle properties were devalued to their recoverable amounts due to the lack of prospects for future use. The carrying amount of the intangible asset was devalued to its recoverable amount due to the lack of prospects for the initially projected profits.

As a result, the Companies recognized impairment losses of ¥621 million ($4,140 thousand), which consisted of assets used for business of ¥88 million ($587 thousand), idle properties of ¥362 million ($2,413 thousand) and an intangible asset of ¥171 million ($1,140 thousand) for the year ended March 31, 2025.

The recoverable amounts of assets used for business and idle properties were measured at the anticipated net selling price at disposition. The Companies principally used the appraisal value, less the cost of disposal, for calculating the net selling price at disposition. The intangible asset (customer relationships) was evaluated for impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and its recoverable amount was calculated as zero.

## 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company, its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, and certain overseas consolidated subsidiaries have funded and/or unfunded defined benefit plans covering their employees. In addition, the Company, certain domestic and overseas consolidated subsidiaries have defined contribution plans.

Under the defined benefit pension plans, which are all funded, employees terminating their employment are entitled to either a lump-sum payment or an annuity, determined based on the rate of pay at the time of termination and years of service.

The severance lump-sum payment plans, which are mostly unfunded, except for a certain plan that is deemed to be funded where a consolidated subsidiary contributes qualified plan assets to an employee retirement benefit trust, provide for a lump-sum payment to terminated employees, determined based on accumulated points allocated each month according to an employee's job classification and performance, or on the rate of pay at the time of termination and years of service.

Certain consolidated subsidiaries account for their retirement benefit plans using the simplified method.

## 15. EQUITY

Japanese companies are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the "Companies Act") . The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:

## a. Dividends

Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the financial year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the stockholders' meeting. Additionally, for companies that meet certain criteria including: (1) having a Board of Directors; (2) having independent auditors; (3) having an Audit &amp; Supervisory Board; and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than the normal two-year term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) at any time during the financial year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. However, such article is not stipulated in the articles of incorporation of the Company.

Semiannual interim dividends can be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors as stipulated in the articles of incorporation of the Company.

## b. Increases/decreases and transfer of common stock, reserve and surplus

The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the stockholders.

## c. Treasury stock and treasury stock acquisition rights

The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury stock and dispose of such treasury stock by resolution of the Board of Directors. The amount of treasury stock purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the stockholders, which is determined by a specific formula.

Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity .

At the Board of Directors' Meeting held on May 14, 2024, the Company resolved matters related to acquisition of its own shares in accordance with Article 156 of the Companies Act, applicable pursuant to Article 165, Paragraph 3 of the said Act. The number of shares acquired based on the resolution was 11,133 thousand shares.

## 16. INCOME TAXES

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in a normal effective statutory tax rate of approximately 30.5% for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, were as follows:

As of March 31, 2025, certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company have tax loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which will start expiring in 2025. As for one of the domestic consolidated subsidiaries, its tax loss carryforwards will gradually expire by 2035. Due to the uncertainty in the realization of such tax loss carryforwards, the Companies have established a valuation allowance to offset a portion of the related deferred tax assets in the amount of ¥5,221 million ($34,807 thousand) and ¥5,022 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Reconciliation between the normal effective statutory tax rate and the actual effective tax rate reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2025, was as follows:

|                                                                                                                                        | 2025   | 2025   |

| Actual effective tax rate ...................................................................................................          | 28.2 % |        |

Information for the year ended March 31, 2024, is not disclosed, because the difference was not more than 5% of the normal effective statutory tax rate.

On March 31, 2025, a tax reform law was enacted in Japan, raising the normal effective statutory tax rate for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries from approximately 30.5% to 31.4%, effective for the financial years beginning on or after April 1, 2026. As a result of this change, the Company recognized a decrease in net deferred tax assets by ¥664 million ($4,427 thousand) and an increase in deferred tax liabilities on revaluation surplus of land by ¥603 million ($4,020 thousand). Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by ¥2,185 million ($14,567 thousand) in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2025. The change also resulted in a decrease in income taxes－deferred of ¥918 million ($6,120 thousand) in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2025.

In accordance with the "Practical Solution on the Accounting and Disclosure Under the Group Tax Sharing System" (Practical Solution No. 42 issued by the ASBJ on August 12, 2021), the Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries have adopted accounting treatment and disclosure of corporate and local corporate income taxes or relevant tax effect accounting.

## b. Basic information to understand revenues from contracts with customers

## (1) Information regarding contracts and performance obligations

The Companies operate in the construction business and the real estate development and other businesses for domestic and overseas customers. In the construction business, the Companies carry out civil engineering, building construction, equipment and other general construction work based on executed construction contracts, and have performance obligations to deliver products such as completed buildings to customers. In the real estate development and other businesses, the Companies carry out real estate development, architectural, structural and other design and engineering services based on executed real estate sales and outsourcing contracts, and have performance obligations to provide services or deliver properties/deliverables to customers.

Because the payment conditions for the promised considerations with customers differ by each contract, there is no material relationship between the timing of satisfaction and the timing of payment for the performance obligations.

## (2) Information regarding determination of the transaction price

Variable consideration based on price indexing clauses stipulated in contracts is included in the transaction price only to the extent where it is probable that, resolution of uncertainty over variable consideration will not cause significant reduction of revenue. In addition, for the financing components included in the promised considerations with customers, adjustment regarding the interest rate is not made as it is considered immaterial.

- (3) Information regarding allocation of the transaction prices to performance obligations

When multiple performance obligations exist in a contract, such as partial delivery of a constructed product, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. If the amount for each performance obligation is specified in the contract, such amount is considered as the individual transaction price. If the amount is not specified, the transaction price is allocated in a reasonable manner based on estimates.

- (4) Information regarding the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations

In the construction business, because building construction is mainly performed on the customer's land, it is considered that the customer has control of the constructed product as the work progresses. Therefore, the Companies consider the performance obligations to be satisfied over time, and estimate the progress of the satisfaction of the performance obligations, and recognize revenue based on the progress.

In sales of properties in the real estate development business, as the Companies have performance obligations to deliver properties based on real estate sales contracts, it is considered that the performance obligations are to be satisfied at a point in time and the revenue is recognized at the time when the properties are delivered. In addition, in the case of design services and other businesses, assets without an alternative use to the Companies, such as the design drawings are created as the work progresses and the Companies are considered to have an enforceable right to receive payment for the work completed to date. Therefore, the Companies consider the performance obligations to be satisfied over time, and estimate the progress of the satisfaction of the performance obligations, and recognize revenue based on the progress.

The progress of the satisfaction is primarily measured based on the ratio of the cumulative costs incurred by the end of financial year against the estimated total costs.

In cases where the progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations cannot be reasonably estimated, such as in the early stage of the contract when the operational budget has not yet been compiled, but the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligations are expected to be recoverable, the revenue is recognized only to the extent of the costs incurred to date that are expected to be recovered.

The alternative treatment is applied in case the duration of transaction, such as from the beginning of the transaction to the point when the performance obligation is expected to be fully satisfied, is distinctively short. In such cases, the revenue is recognized at the point when the performance obligations are fully satisfied rather than being recognized over time.

## c. Contract balances

Receivables from contracts with customers, contract assets and contract liabilities at the beginning and end of the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, were as follows:

|                                                                                    | Millions of Yen   | Millions of Yen   | U.S. Dollars Thousands of   |

| Balance at end of year ........................................................... | 493,875           | 456,879           | 3,292,500                   |
| Contract assets:                                                                   |                   |                   |                             |

| Contract liabilities:                                                              |                   |                   |                             |

| Balance at end of year ........................................................... | 309,557           | 230,558           | 2,063,713                   |

Contract assets are the rights of the Companies related to the performance obligations satisfied based on construction contracts in the construction business and outsourcing contracts in the real estate development and other businesses. Contract assets are transferred to receivables from contracts with customers when such rights become unconditional. Considerations for such performance obligations have been invoiced and received in accordance with the payment condition set out in the individual agreements.

Contract liabilities are the advances received from customers before the provision of services based on construction contracts in the construction business and real estate sales contracts and outsourcing contracts in the real estate development and other businesses. Contract liabilities are released upon revenue recognition.

The amounts of revenues recognized for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, which were included in the balance of contract liabilities at the beginning of the years, were ¥201,250 million ($1,341,667 thousand) and ¥158,793 million, respectively. In addition, changes in contract assets are mainly due to revenue recognition (an increase in contract assets) and transfers to receivables (a decrease in contract assets). The balance at the end of the year fluctuates due to the effect of the timing of the completion of largescale construction projects in the construction business.

Revenues recognized for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in the past years were immaterial.

## d. Transaction Prices Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations

The following table shows the summary of the transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations in the construction business that are unsatisfied as of March 31, 2025:

## 19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES

## a. Policy for financial instruments

The Companies use financial instruments, mainly loans from banks, commercial paper and bonds, based on their capital financing plans for construction and development businesses. Cash surpluses, if any, are invested in low-risk financial assets such as deposits. It is the Companies' policy to use derivatives only for actual operating requirements, not for speculation.

## b. Nature, extent of risks arising from financial instruments, and risk management for financial instruments

Receivables, such as notes and accounts receivable ― trade, are exposed to customer credit risks. The Companies thoroughly enforce credit risk management, which principally includes credit research at the time of obtaining work and timely monitoring of credit standings.

Payment terms of payables, such as notes and accounts payable―trade, are within one year.

Although marketable securities and investments in securities are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations, the Companies use the internal management system to recognize their fair values periodically.

Loans from banks, commercial paper and bonds are used to raise funds for construction and development business.

Derivatives mainly include foreign exchange forward contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps, which are used to manage exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of future demand and collection of foreign-currencydenominated funds, and from changes in interest rates of loans from banks and bonds. Please see Note 20 for more details regarding derivatives.

In addition, the Company entered into committed loan facility agreements totaling ¥200,000 million ($1,333,333 thousand) with several Japanese banks to manage liquidity risk related to fund procurement.

## c. Fair values of financial instruments

Fair values of financial instruments are as follows. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, other current assets (time deposits due after three months of the date of acquisition), short-term borrowings, commercial paper, notes and accounts payable ― trade and income taxes payable are not disclosed because the maturities of the said financial instruments are short and the carrying values approximate fair value. In addition, the fair values of investments in partnerships and other similar entities in which the net amount of equity interest is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not disclosed. The carrying amounts of such investments, including operational investments in securities, were ¥20,318 million ($135,453 thousand) and ¥20,013 million as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Also, please see Note 20 for the details of the fair values of derivatives.

## (1) Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amount, fair value and unrealized gain (loss) of financial instruments as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, were as follows. However, financial instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are not included.

## e. Financial instruments categorized by fair value hierarchy

The fair value of financial instruments is categorized into the following three levels, depending on the observability and significance of the inputs used in making fair value measurements:

Level 1: Fair values measured by using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair values measured by using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Fair values measured by using unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities.

If multiple inputs are used that have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the fair value is categorized at the lowest level in the fair value measurement among the levels to which each of these inputs belongs.

## Notes:

(1) Description of valuation methodologies and inputs used for measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities

## Marketable securities and Investments in securities

The fair values of listed equity securities, listed investment trusts and government and corporate bonds are measured at the quoted market prices. The fair values of listed equity securities, listed investment trusts and government bonds are categorized as Level 1, as they are traded in active markets. The fair values of corporate bonds are categorized as Level 2, as the quoted market prices of corporate bonds are not considered to be observed in active markets due to low market transactions. The fair values of unlisted investment trusts are measured at net asset value per unit, and are categorized as Level 2. The fair values of unlisted equity securities held by certain overseas subsidiaries are principally measured by adjusted net asset method, and are categorized as Level 3.

## Derivative transactions

The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps are measured by using discounted present value techniques considering observable inputs such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate, and are categorized as Level 2.

## Notes and accounts receivable ― trade

The carrying amounts of notes and accounts receivable―trade with short maturities approximate fair value, and are categorized as Level 2.

The fair values of notes and accounts receivable ― trade with maturities of over one year are measured at the amount to be received at maturity discounted at the Companies' assumed corporate discount rate with consideration for the remaining terms and credit risks, and are categorized as Level 2.

## Long-term loans receivable and Long-term loans to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates

The carrying amounts of long-term loans receivable and long-term loans to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates with fluctuating interest rates approximate fair value because the variable interest rates reflect market rates in a short period of time and the credit standings of the borrowers are not substantially changed, and are categorized as Level 2.

The fair values of long-term loans receivable and long-term loans to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates with fixed interest rates are principally measured by discounting the cash flows at the Companies' assumed corporate discount rates by adding the credit spread to the appropriate indexes, such as the yield of government bonds, and are categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the materiality of the effect of unobservable inputs in the measurement of fair value.

## Corporate bonds

The fair values of corporate bonds issued by the Company are principally measured at the quoted market prices. The fair values of these corporate bonds are categorized as Level 2, as the quoted market prices of corporate bonds are not considered to be observed in active markets due to low market transactions. The fair values of other corporate bonds are measured by discounting the cash flows related to the debt at discount rates that take into account the remaining periods of the bonds and credit risks, and are categorized as Level 2.

## Long-term loans

The carrying amounts of long-term loans with fluctuating interest rates approximate fair value because the variable interest rates reflect market rates in a short period of time and the credit standing of the Company is not substantially changed, and are categorized as Level 2.

The fair values of long-term loans with fixed interest rates are measured by discounting the cash flows related to the debt at the Companies' assumed corporate borrowing rates, and are categorized as Level 2.

## 20. DERIVATIVES

The Companies enter into derivatives, including principally foreign exchange forward contracts, currency swap agreements, interest rate swap agreements and interest rate option agreements.

The Companies do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and it is the Companies' policy to use derivatives solely for the purpose of reducing market risks and financing costs in accordance with internal regulations.

All derivative transactions are entered into to hedge interest and foreign currency exposures incorporated within the Companies ' business. Accordingly, market risk in these derivatives is basically offset by opposite movements in the value of hedged assets or liabilities.

Because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major domestic or overseas financial institutions, the Companies do not anticipate any losses arising from credit risk.

Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.

## (1) Description of reportable segments

The Group's reportable segments are those for which separate financial information is available and regular evaluation by the Board of Directors of the Company is being performed in order to decide how resources are allocated among the Group and to assess performance of each reportable segment.

The Group operates in a wide and multilateral business. The Company organizes management divisions for each operating segment, such as civil engineering, building construction, real estate development and other, which strategize and develop their business. Additionally, the Company's domestic and overseas subsidiaries and affiliates collaborate with the Company to expand the range of the Group's business.

Therefore, the Group consists of five reportable segments as follows:

| Civil Engineering: Civil engineering in the construction business operated by the Company                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Building Construction: Building construction in the construction business operated by the Company                                                                                                                                                            |
| Real Estate Development and Other: Real estate development business, architectural, structural and other design business  and engineering business operated by the Company                                                                                   |
| Domestic Subsidiaries and Affiliates: Sales of construction materials, special construction and engineering services,  comprehensive leasing business, building rental business and others mainly in Japan  operated by domestic subsidiaries and affiliates |
| Overseas Subsidiaries and Affiliates: Construction business, real estate development business and others overseas such as in  North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and other areas operated by overseas  subsidiaries and affiliates                         |

(2) Methods of measurement for the amounts of sales, profit (loss), assets, liabilities and other items for each reportable segment The accounting policies of each reportable segment are consistent with those disclosed in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." The profit or loss of each reportable segment is measured by its operating income or loss. The contracts between the reportable segments are entered into on an arm's-length basis and in the normal course of business.
