      "### Review of FY2024 and our outlook for the future\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first year of the Kajima Group Medium-Term Business Plan (2024–2026), we achieved our fourth\n",
      "consecutive year of increased revenue and profit, delivering record-high revenue of ¥2,911.8 billion\n",
      "and our second-highest net income of ¥125.8 billion. By maintaining an ROE above 10%, we assess that\n",
      "our Group continues to deliver the profit growth and capital efficiency we aim for. Furthermore, our\n",
      "earnings per share (EPS) and stock price have continued to show steady improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at recent business trends, the domestic construction business faced several challenges,\n",
      "including rising construction costs and compliance with new overtime regulations. However, due to\n",
      "detailed pre-contract planning, contracts with appropriate terms, and ongoing efforts to improve\n",
      "productivity during construction, we achieved profits that exceeded our initial plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our real estate development business, although both domestic and overseas markets experienced\n",
      "shifts in financial conditions, our domestic operations showed relatively stable progress. In\n",
      "overseas markets like the U.S., where policy trends remain uncertain, we determined that the\n",
      "environment required careful consideration of the timing for both investments and asset sales.\n",
      "Despite this challenging environment, our overseas business as a whole has recorded profits above a\n",
      "certain level, regardless of recent fluctuations, and has grown into a reliable pillar of earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For FY2025, we are forecasting record highs for both consolidated revenue and net income, projected\n",
      "at ¥2,950 billion and ¥130 billion, respectively. This is based on factors such as the large number\n",
      "of domestic civil engineering projects reaching their peak, the enhancement of profitability within\n",
      "domestic building construction, and an anticipated recovery in overseas performance as markets\n",
      "rebound.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Domestic construction business\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic construction demand remains robust, with a steady pipeline of projects expected over the\n",
      "next four to five years. However, from a sustainability perspective in the construction business,\n",
      "numerous challenges remain to be addressed, such as securing a future workforce and improving\n",
      "productivity. This requires continuous investment and, crucially, a stable source of investment\n",
      "capital (i.e., gross construction profit).\n",
      "\n",
      "One of our key priorities is investing in human capital, which focuses not only on wages, training,\n",
      "and working conditions for our Group employees but also on the skilled workers of our partner\n",
      "companies, who are the ones actually carrying out the construction. Enhancing conditions for skilled\n",
      "workers is essential for creating a sustainable construction industry—an urgent priority amid\n",
      "growing labor shortages. We expect these efforts to also help us maintain and strengthen our own\n",
      "construction capabilities over the medium- to long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, as a technology-based company, we believe ongoing investment in technology remains\n",
      "indispensable. In addition to R&amp;D in advanced technologies, optimal construction methods, and\n",
      "eco-friendly materials, we are continuing to invest in measures that address labor shortages and the\n",
      "transfer of skills, such as reducing\n",
      "\n",
      "KAJIMA Integrated Report 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "labor requirements, increasing efficiency, and improving visualization in on-site operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the pace of digitalization accelerates, we believe it is valuable to pursue technology\n",
      "development not only with internal resources but also by investing in startups and other companies\n",
      "to gain new, efficient perspectives. We are actively seeking collaboration partners both in Japan\n",
      "and overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costs associated with these initiatives are gradually increasing, with most recorded as selling,\n",
      "general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. To cover these costs and secure operating income, we\n",
      "recognize the importance of increasing both our revenue and construction gross profit margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the margin, efforts can be made on both the price and cost sides. While we are, of\n",
      "course, working to improve production efficiency on the cost side, we must also focus on the price\n",
      "side. Given the anticipated labor shortage, supply-demand constraints, and increasing complexity of\n",
      "technologically advanced projects, we believe this value should be reflected in the price and\n",
      "recognized by our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the recent trend toward larger-scale construction projects and extended construction\n",
      "periods, the resurgence of interest rates in the domestic market has further highlighted the need to\n",
      "resolve issues such as the terms and timing of payment collection from our clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many private-sector projects, payments from clients are heavily weighted toward project\n",
      "completion. In contrast, we pay our partner companies on a monthly basis in accordance with the work\n",
      "completed. This places a heavy financial burden on the prime contractor in the form of accounts\n",
      "receivable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening the financial health of our partner companies is essential for a sustainable supply\n",
      "chain, and this fiscal year, we have further accelerated our payments. However, since our cash\n",
      "conversion cycle is getting longer, we continue to urge our clients to make payments according to\n",
      "construction progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "This issue of payment collection is not unique to Kajima. Addressing issues like price negotiations\n",
      "over rising construction costs and ensuring appropriate construction periods is a significant\n",
      "challenge for the entire construction industry, so we are working toward an industry-wide response.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Real estate development business\n",
      "\n",
      "For over six years, we have been actively investing in the real estate business as a core growth\n",
      "strategy. Our profit levels have improved compared to the initial period, and we have steadily\n",
      "expanded the scope of our business in terms of scale, geographic reach, and portfolio. We assess\n",
      "that this progress is in alignment with our growth strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the Medium-Term Business Plan, our domestic real estate development business will\n",
      "accumulate quality assets while also preparing for upcoming portfolio turnover. In addition to\n",
      "rental and sales income derived from conventional office developments, we aim to generate sales\n",
      "revenue from assets including residential properties, hotels, and logistics facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "While gross investment in our overseas development business will increase relative to the last two\n",
      "Medium-Term Business Plans, we anticipate a decrease in net investment due to higher capital\n",
      "recoupment from asset sales. We believe we have entered a phase where the cycle of investment and\n",
      "recoupment is functioning effectively, generating profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Business strategies vary across countries and regions, influenced by differences in local business\n",
      "environments and the maturity of real estate sales markets. Our plan focuses on logistics warehouse\n",
      "development, which follows a short-term turnover model, in the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia.\n",
      "This is complemented by sales income from assets such as rental apartments (U.S.), renewable energy\n",
      "facilities (Europe), and hotels (Southeast Asia), along with stable rental income from long-term\n",
      "holdings like mixed-use facilities (Southeast Asia).\n",
      "\n",
      "To account for varying profitability and cash turnover rates across countries, regions, asset types,\n",
      "and business models, we make project decisions using hurdle rates tailored to each project and key\n",
      "indicators like IRR and NOI yield. During internal committee meetings, we explicitly ask our\n",
      "business divisions to clarify their cash turnover rates and exit strategies for assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also prepare a balance sheet for each business division and monitor their status and outlook from\n",
      "the perspectives of capital efficiency and financial soundness. While our domestic and overseas\n",
      "development businesses differ in market characteristics and business models, we share common\n",
      "standards. For capital efficiency, ROIC must exceed WACC (about 5–6%) and ROE must exceed the cost\n",
      "of equity (about 7–8%). For financial soundness, one of the key criteria is ensuring that the total\n",
      "risk amount of our projects remains below our owners' equity. At times, we instruct our business\n",
      "divisions to consider measures such as managing portfolio turnover or moving assets off the balance\n",
      "sheet to reduce risk and improve capital efficiency. However, considering the possibility of\n",
      "temporary downturns in earnings, business decisions and assessments are conducted with a medium- to\n",
      "long-term perspective, rather than relying on annual results.\n",

      "#### Update on our financial strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "Since profit growth is accelerating faster than we anticipated when the Medium-Term Business Plan\n",
      "was formulated, we have adjusted our cash allocation for the three-year period. We now plan to\n",
      "allocate our cash inflow of ¥1,500 billion (up ¥100 billion from the initial plan) as follows: about\n",
      "¥1,270 billion (up ¥70 billion) for growth investments and about ¥230 billion (up ¥30 billion) for\n",
      "stockholder returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through ongoing dialogue with investors, we have heard expectations for an upward revision of our\n",
      "ROE target (above 10% level). In the present phase of accumulating development assets, we believe\n",
      "the current target is appropriate, as our priority is to maintain owners' equity (the denominator of\n",
      "ROE) at a level commensurate with the risk volume of our development assets. Aiming for sustainable\n",
      "growth, we consider that it is more appropriate to increase ROE by continuing initiatives and\n",
      "investments that increase the absolute amount of net income (the numerator) rather than by reducing\n",
      "the risk buffer in our equity through excessive stockholder returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Growth investment\n",
      "\n",
      "To steadily achieve sustainable profit growth, we are continuously formulating and implementing\n",
      "proactive investment plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at our consolidated net income levels, we noted that profits were around ¥20 billion\n",
      "prior to FY2015. They rose to about ¥70 billion due to improved profitability in the domestic\n",
      "construction business. Subsequently, growth in our real estate development and overseas businesses\n",
      "has allowed us to consistently achieve profits of over ¥100 billion. We are now well-positioned to\n",
      "deliver a record-high profit of ¥130 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This profit growth over the past ten years is partly driven by external factors such as economic\n",
      "tailwinds and government policies. However, we believe that this mainly stems from our growth\n",
      "strategies, which include successful investments in our real estate development and overseas\n",
      "businesses while also strengthening our management foundation through investments in human capital,\n",
      "R&amp;D, and digital technology.\n",
